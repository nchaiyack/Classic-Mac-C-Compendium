Description

	ScreenFlip performs ‘animated’ horizontal and vertical flips of your
	screen’s contents. Silly, no?


Features

	•  Compatible with After Dark (both 2.0 and 3.0), DarkSide of the Mac and UnderWare.
	•  Flicker-free animation.
	•  Does not use any permanent System memory under After Dark 2.0.
	•  Has an animated About Box and thumbnail.
	•  Runs under both MultiModule and the Randomizer — without crashing.
	•  Comes with extensively documented source code (THINK C 7.0.4 format).
	•  Both the module and the source code are free.


Restrictions & Technical Remarks

	•  ScreenFlip needs Color QuickDraw to run. A color screen is not essential, 
	however: on a Black & White SE/30 the module works just fine.

	•  Multiple-monitor setups are supported, but not actively used — the animation
	always runs on the main monitor only (and will simply black out any other screens).

	•  ScreenFlip tries to be a well-behaved, system-friendly module. It will,
	for instance, not reserve any permanent memory in your system heap. That
	means that having ScreenFlip selected costs you no more memory than having
	the default ‘Starry Night’ module selected.

	•  The ‘Instant Flips’ option uses a lot of (temporary) memory. If the module 
	won’t run because of this, you can try quitting one or two applications.
	Otherwise you can just uncheck the option. There’s no need to restart.

	•  I cannot guarantee that ScreenFlip will work with versions of After Dark
	earlier than 2.0u. The same holds for any other programs that are supposed
	to be able to play After Dark modules (except for DarkSide and UnderWare,
	which I had access to). In all such cases, ScreenFlip may run, or it may not.
	Feedback about compatibility issues will be much appreciated.
	
	•  At the moment of writing the latest version numbers of the screensavers
	ScreenFlip has been tested to work with are 3.0b for After Dark, 4.2 for DarkSide
	and 1.0.1 for UnderWare. Free updaters for these programs are readily available
	on the Internet and on all the major commercial software archives. See also the
	URL appendix at the end of this document.


Version history

	1.0		28 Jul 1994
						—	Initial release.

	1.1		24 Feb 1995
						—	Fixed a bug that made the About Box animation use the same inter flip
								delay as the real module, instead of  no delay at all, which was the
								intended behaviour.
						—	The About Box now wil take advantage of After Dark 3.0’s expanded
								about box area (provided you’re running 3.0, of course. Duh.).
						—	Added animated thumbnail for After Dark 3.0.
						—	Cleaned up the source code.

1.1.1	19 May 1995
						—	Documentation update. No changes to the actual module.
						—	Removed all references to the After Dark FTP Site and the Programmers’ List,
								because both are now (temporarily) defunct.
	

Credits & Acknowledgments

	The text shadowing effect in the module’s About Box was created using the
	freeware Adobe Photoshop plug-in filter Drop Shadow, by Alien Skin Software.

	As always, thanks to Lloyd “Screensaver FAQ” Wood for feedback and
	beta-testing.

	ScreenFlip was created using THINK C 7.0.4,  Think Reference 2.0.1,
	ResEdit 2.1.3, BBEdit 3.1.1, and Adobe Photoshop 2.5.1.


Known Problems

	•	Under certain very rare circumstances (specifically: if you have a
	multi-monitor setup in which your main monitor (the one with the menu
	bar) is not placed in the ‘left-upper-most’ position in the Monitors control
	panel) the module will start drawing garbage on your screen when
	activated. This is an entirely cosmetical bug, and I know precisely what’s
	causing it — I just don’t know how to fix it, yet.

	•	Under certain other not-so-rare circumstances (specifically: if After
	Dark starts displaying a “Please Wake Up” message while the module
	is running, e.g. when a background application wants your attention) the
	module will also start drawing garbage to your screen. This too, is an entirely
	cosmetic bug — but I’l be darned if I know what’s causing it, or how to
	fix it.

	I would appreciate hearing about any other bugs or problems you may encounter 
	with ScreenFlip.

For Programmers

	The most recent version of the After Dark programmer’s interface (which
	also gets updated sometimes — the copy that came with your diskette may
	be outdated!) is available from the major Internet archive sites such
	as sumex.stanford.edu, mac.archive.umich.edu and their mirrors. 

	You may also want to take a look at The Swarm, another screensaver module
	I wrote, which also comes with documented source code.


Final Remark	

	Nobody who owns a Macintosh screensaver package should be without
	the most recent version of Lloyd Wood’s Screensaver FAQ (Frequently 
	Asked Questions) List. Copies of this list are also available from all major
	archive sites on or off the Internet. It is a must-have. Trust me.

Enjoy,
