Sort is an After Dark module that (you guessed it!) sorts. It works with MultiModule (where you can give it a small enough screen that it can actually finish sorting in a few minutes) and with DarkSide, a FreeWare screen saver.The source code demonstrates three useful things:1. How to write and debug a module with Think Pascal, then recompile it easily for After Dark.2. Several sorting algorithms. However, the sort routines probably aren’t useful without being rewritten for your specific application.3. Direct to screen drawing. My routines are a bit faster than SetCPixel and GetCPixel, and they are guaranteed not to work on some hardware because direct-to-screen drawing is generally discouraged by Apple.4. Using Object Pascal in a CODE resource.(I know there are four things in the list. But one of them isn’t useful. You’ll have to figure out which one yourself.)To build, you need Think Pascal 4.0.2 (other versions won’t work because of a workaround of a bug in the RSRCRuntime.Lib library), and some of the interface files that come with it. Everything else is included and ready to go.It should run on any Mac produced in the last 7 or 8 years, i.e. any Mac that runs After Dark.It has only been tested on a PowerMacintosh running system 7.1.2 and a Mac Plus running system 4.1. By the intermediate value theorem, it will work on anything in between. (-:I, the author, am Scott Lindhurst, a graduate student in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.

The module and source code are copyright by me, Scott Lindhurst. But you can distribute them any way you like. However, if you use the source code in your program, you must give me credit in your about box and documentation. And I’d like to hear about your application, too.Version 1.0Works with Multimodule and much better in color (now that I have a color machine to develop on).Version 0.99First release—for an After Dark programming contest.
