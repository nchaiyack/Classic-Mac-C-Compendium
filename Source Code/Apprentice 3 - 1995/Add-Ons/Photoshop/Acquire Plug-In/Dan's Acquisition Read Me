Dan's Example Plug-In
1994-04-27

Enclosed is example source code for a Photoshop acquisition Plug-In.  The example is written i n Think Pascal 4 and should be easy to port to the Metrowerks compiler (when it is ready).  One should read over the documentation that comes with the Photoshop Plug-Ins development kit before mucking about with this example.  

If you have any comments, suggestions, or bug fixes concerning this Plug-In example, please Email me at:
