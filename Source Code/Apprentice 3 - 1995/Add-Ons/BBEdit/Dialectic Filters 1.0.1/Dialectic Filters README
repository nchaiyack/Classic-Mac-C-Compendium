Description

	In 1994 Mark Pilgrim released version 1.2 of his application Dialectic, which
	transmogrifies English text in various entertaining ways. I have used his
	source code to implement the same set of filters as an extension for
	BBEdit and BBEdit Lite, the Macintosh text editors from Bare Bones Software.

	Or perhaps I should rather say:

Remarks

	•  The Dialectic Filters are compatible with both BBEdit and BBEdit Lite, but need
	version 2.0 or later to run. Undo-functionality is available with version 3.0 and later.

	•	Using radio buttons as a means to choose among dialects is only a temporary solution. 
	A scrollable list would be much more compliant with the Human Interface guidelines (not
	to mention better suited to future expansions of the filter set), but is also a bit more
	difficult to program, so I decided to use the less perfect but easier solution for this first
	version of the extension.

	•  Rather than adapting or rewriting the original filters and then having to debug
	them all over again, I decided to make the Dialectic Filters source code plug-in compatible 
	with the original filters. This has the additional advantage that if Mark ever updates 
	his filters or writes new ones, all I have to do is recompile in order to incorporate
	them in the extension.

	•  The source code to the Dialectic Filters extension is free, and should be available
	from the same software repositories that carry the extension itself. If you can’t find
	it you can always get the source from me through e-mail. See also the URLs section
	below.

	•  This extension is released to the public under the GNU General Public License
	(see below) because the original Dialectic code was released that way (and hence my
  adaptation has to be as well), not because I am personally a supporter of the Free
  Software Foundation’s approach to software licensing.

Credits & Acknowledgments

	The biggest thank you goes of course to Mark Pilgrim for writing Dialectic, for 
	allowing me to use his source code, and for his general enthousiasm about this project.

  Also thanks to Rich Siegel and Bare Bones Software for BBEdit, for providing 
	such a great development environment, and for patiently answering my programming 
	questions.

	I learned a lot by studying the source code to Craig H. Maynard’s excellent
  BBEdit extension LineSort.
	
	As always, thanks to Lloyd “Screensaver FAQ” Wood for feedback and
	beta-testing.

	The Dialectic Filters were programmed using THINK C 7.0.4,  Think Reference 2.0.1,
	ResEdit 2.1.3 and BBEdit 3.0.1.


All comments, questions, and bug reports concerning this extension will be
more than welcome. I look forward to receiving your feedback.

Enjoy,
