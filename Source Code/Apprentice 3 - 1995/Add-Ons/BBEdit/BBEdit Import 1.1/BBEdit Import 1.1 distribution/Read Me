BBEdit Import extension=======================Version:      1.1 (15 July 1994)Written by:   Marco Piovanelli (piovanel@dsi.unimi.it)This BBEdit extension allows BBEdit (and applications that support theBBEdit extension architecture, like EasyView) to take advantage of theClaris XTND System and any available XTND translators.The XTND technology allows conformant applications to import (and export)documents saved in several file formats, like MacWrite II, Microsoft Wordand RTF, provided you have the corresponding translator installed in your"Claris Translators" folder in the "Claris" folder in your system folder.The commercial version of BBEdit supports the XTND technology directly, sothis extension is of little use to users of that version.On the other hand, this extension can be a useful complement to BBEdit Lite.This extension will not work on systems prior to System 7.0.Changes from version 1.0------------------------*  When importing a document containing inline pictures, a "<PICT>" tag   is now inserted in the translated text stream in place of the (missing)   figures.*  Some special characters, like column-break and page-break, were not   translated correctly by BBEdit Import 1.0; this bug has been fixed.*  Cosmetic change: the format pop-up menu in the Import File dialog box   is now separated from the standard dialog items by a gray line.*  A few additional bug fixes.
