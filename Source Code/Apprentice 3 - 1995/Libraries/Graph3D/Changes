Removed definitions of SetR, SetG, SetB from Color3D.h (they were never defined), and chhanged
istream &operator>>(istream &in, Color3D &color) to use SetxDouble.

Changes result in ProjectPoint to static so we can return its address safely.

Made Line3D::Origin and Line3D::Direction return Vector3D rather than
Vector3D &.  Can't really have a const member function return address
of member, I think.

Made third parameter of DrawLineNoClip const.
