The project files here include all of the source files you will need for a complete TCL build of the demonstration application MiniTelnet. You will need to point the compilers to the folders where all of the source code is contained; instructions for doing so follow on this page.

A complete build of the application will take between 5 and 15 minutes, depending on the configuration of your machine and the compiler you are using.


To compile with Symantec C++ 7.0:

  * Create a new folder titled (Aliases) in this folder.
  * Make aliases to the folders MiniTelnet source, Terminal pane, and TurboTCP source.
     Place those aliases in the (Aliases) folder.

To compile with Metrowerks C++ 68K or PPC:

  * Open the project files here.
  * Enter the Preferences dialog, Access Paths panel.
  * Add access paths to the three folders MiniTelnet source, Terminal pane,
     TurboTCP source, and the modified TCL source code (see next item).
  * Note: You will need to use the TCL 2.0 CodeWarrior Port Package to compile
     TurboTCP with the Metrowerks compilers. It is available for FTP on the
     host daemon.ncsa.uiuc.edu in the directory /pub/TCL/contributors/Eric_Scouten.
