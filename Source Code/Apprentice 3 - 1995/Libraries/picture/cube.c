These actions areprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, bymodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, andall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifyingthe Library or works based on it.  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from theoriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Librarysubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any furtherrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties tothis License.  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement orotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do notexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannotdistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under thisLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence youmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patentlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library byall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, thenthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be torefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under anyparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe anypatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of anysuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting theintegrity of the free software distribution system which isimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have madegenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributedthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of thatsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willingto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannotimpose that choice.This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed tobe a consequence of the rest of this License.  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted incertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, theoriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may addan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thusexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as ifwritten in the body of this License.  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or newversions of the Library General Public License from time to time.Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Libraryspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and"any later version", you have the option of following the terms andconditions either of that version or of any later version published bythe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify alicense version number, you may choose any version ever published bythe Free Software Foundation.  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other freeprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which iscopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the FreeSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Ourdecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free statusof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharingand reuse of software generally.			    NO WARRANTY  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NOWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OROTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANYKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THEIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THELIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUMETHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO INWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFYAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOUFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL ORCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THELIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEINGRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR AFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IFSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCHDAMAGES.		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatestpossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software thateveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permittingredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of theordinary General Public License).  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It issafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivelyconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU    Library General Public License for more details.    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free    Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or yourschool, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, ifnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990  Ty Coon, President of ViceThat's all there is to it!ern Nlm_ShellTool Nlm_ParentWindowShell (Nlm_GraphiC a){  Nlm_ShellTool  rsult;  Nlm_WindoW     w;  rsult = NULL;  if (a != NULL) {    w = Nlm_GetParentWindow (a);    rsult = Nlm_GetWindowShell (w);  }  return rsult;}extern Nlm_WindoW Nlm_SavePortIfNeeded (Nlm_GraphiC a, Nlm_Boolean savePort){  Nlm_WindoW  newwindow;  Nlm_WindoW  oldwindow;  Nlm_WindoW  rsult;  rsult = NULL;  if (a != NULL && savePort) {    savePort = Nlm_GetAllParentsVisible (a);    if (savePort) {      oldwindow = Nlm_CurrentWindow ();      newwindow = Nlm_GetParentWindow (a);      savePort = (Nlm_Boolean) (oldwindow != newwindow);      if (savePort) {        Nlm_UseWindow (newwindow);        rsult = oldwindow;      }    }  }  return rsult;}extern Nlm_WindoW Nlm_SavePort (Nlm_Handle a){  return Nlm_SavePortIfNeeded ((Nlm_GraphiC) a, TRUE);}extern void Nlm_RestorePort (Nlm_WindoW w){  if (Nlm_processUpdatesFirstVal) {    Nlm_Update ();  }  if (w != NULL) {    Nlm_UseWindow (w);  }}extern void Nlm_SetClose (Nlm_WindoW w, Nlm_WndActnProc cls){  Nlm_WindowData  wdata;  if (w != NULL) {    Nlm_GetWindowData (w, &wdata);    wdata.close = cls;    Nlm_SetWindowData (w, &wdata);  }}extern void Nlm_SetActivate (Nlm_WindoW w, Nlm_WndActnProc act){  Nlm_WindowData  wdata;  if (w != NULL) {    Nlm_GetWindowData (w, &wdata);    wdata.activate = act;    Nlm_SetWindowData (w, &wdata);  } else {    appWndAct = act;  }}extern void Nlm_SetDeactivate (Nlm_WindoW w, Nlm_WndActnProc deact){  Nlm_WindowData  wdata;  if (w != NULL) {    Nlm_GetWindowData (w, &wdata);    wdata.deactivate = deact;    Nlm_SetWindowData (w, &wdata);  } else {    appWndDeact = deact;  }}extern void Nlm_SetResize (Nlm_WindoW w, Nlm_WndActnProc resiz){  Nlm_WindowData  wdata;  if (w != NULL) {    Nlm_GetWindowData (w, &wdata);    wdata.resize = resiz;    Nlm_SetWindowData (w, &wdata);  }}extern void Nlm_SetColorMap (Nlm_WindoW w, Nlm_Uint2 totalColors,                              Nlm_Uint1Ptr red, Nlm_Uint1Ptr green,                              Nlm_Uint1Ptr blue){  Nlm_WindowData  wdata;  Nlm_Int2        i;#ifdef WIN_MSWIN  LOGPALETTE    * palette;  PALETTEENTRY  * p;#endif#ifdef WIN_MAC  RGBColor        col;#endif#ifdef WIN_MOTIF  Visual        * vis;  XVisualInfo     visinfo;  Window          rootwin;  int             plane_m[1];  int             pixels[256];  XColor          colorCell;#endif  if ( totalColors>256 ) return;  if (w != NULL) {    Nlm_GetWindowData (w, &wdata);#ifdef WIN_MSWIN    if ( GetDeviceCaps (Nlm_currentHDC, RASTERCAPS) &  RC_PALETTE ){      if ( wdata.cMap != NULL ){        DeleteObject( wdata.cMap );        wdata.cMap = NULL;      }      if ( totalColors!=0 ) {        palette = (LOGPALETTE*)MemNew (sizeof(LOGPALETTE) +                                totalColors*sizeof(PALETTEENTRY));        if ( palette != NULL ) {          palette->palVersion = 0x300;          palette->palNumEntries = totalColors;  ????    fo       \l  [l   OEM*QUANTUM*SEAGATE*TOSHIBA*
