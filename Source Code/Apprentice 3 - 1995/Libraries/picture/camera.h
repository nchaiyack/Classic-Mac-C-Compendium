The camera's location is given in world*	coordinates.  If you were to translate the camera to the*	origin of the world coordinate system, then (1) yaw is the angle*	the camera is pointing as rotated about the world's vertical*	(y) axis (with respect to the direction of the world z axis);*	(2) pitch is the angle it is pointing with respect to the world*	horizontal (x-z) plane; (3) roll is the angle the camera's "up"*	direction makes from the world's y axis, as measured about the*	axis in which the camera is pointing.  Note that yaw and roll*	are undefined when pitch is PI/2 or -PI/2; i.e., when the*	camera points straight up or down.******************************************************************/class	Camera:public Generic_Class{private:	World_To_Camera	*world_to_camera;	double			focal_length;	public:	Camera(void);	virtual void	set_position(double,double,double,double,double,double);	virtual void	set_focal_length(double);	virtual boolean	take_photo(Coord2*,Coord3*);	virtual			~Camera(void);};# endif
