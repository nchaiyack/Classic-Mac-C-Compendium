File: TCP++.noteAuthor: Josh Adams (jadams@eng.umd.edu)Date: April 28, 1995This distribution (TCP++) is all the files necessary to make the TCP++ library file (the lib file is also included...). I got mostof the code from the inetd source distribution. That included someMPW libraries and source. I modified the source, hoping to make itwork. I don't pretend to be really smart at this or anything, butI am trying to write a simple little TCP server/client app, and wading through MacTCP was getting a little hairy.This was made for the express purpose of easy TCP programming for CodeWarrior in C++. This requires C++!Now, I have a (relatively) nice library that does nice things, like tcpCreate, tcpSend, etc. The AddressXlation stuff has a nicerinterface, sorta.The myUtils.* files were not written by me at all. They are needed for a few things, tho.Okay, how to use this stuff. Well, hopefully you can compile thelibrary (although you don't need to, since it's already done). But,if you do use this in a CodeWarrior project, you will need to include in that project your ANSI library. I suggest you use 4-byteints, otherwise you could have real big overflow problems. I did.You'll notice that the CPlusPlus.lib and MacOS.lib files are includedin this library. I did that for ease of use for myself. If you want,feel free to take them out and build the project without them. Sincethis code needs C++, I figured I may as well not have to keep includingthe CPlusPlus.lib.Caveats: Since I'm not a programming god, there is a good chance I screwed up while updating it for CodeWarrior. Also, I don't know whatthis will do on a PowerMac...Please mail me with anything that I would find interesting (especiallybugs and such).I also worked on a Berkeley Sockets library for CodeWarrior. Seems muchless stable, but its good for porting Unix programs (except that theyhave that cool function fork()...)
