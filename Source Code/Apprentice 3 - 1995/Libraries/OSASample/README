Welcome to the PowerPC C++ OSA Component Sample!

This is a port of Apples "OSA Sample Component" to PPC CodeWarrior C++. It might be useful if 
you are writing an OSA Component yourself, because it a) uses C++ instead of Pascal and b)
it illustrates the nontrivial RoutineDescriptor jugglings necessary to write PowerPC OSA
components.

At the beginning of the Main() function, you'll find some commented out debug code. If you 
uncomment it, you will drop into MacsBug on every component call, but for some mysterious
reasons, this option actually *causes* crashes under certain circumstances.

Please report all problems to me, but don't expect me to be an OSA expert. I'm still rather
new in this area of work. In fact, I would appreciate it greatly if someone could explain
scripting contexts to me.

Here's the relevant excerpt from Apple's About Note:

About Sample OSA Components

The AppleScriptª component is an OSA component that implements the AppleScriptª scripting 
language. It is possible to have other OSA components that support other scripting languages. 
We have include here some other OSA components to illustrate the concept.

OSASampleComponent is a sample program on how to write an OSA Component. This is very 
preliminary; some of the details may be wrong and not all OSA calls are implemented. 
The only thing it does is to translate "one", "two", "three" to "1", "2", "3" etc. The 
source is included so that you can start to build your own OSA Component. After you 
install the component, you should be able to see it from the pop up menu in Script 
Editor and you can use OSASampleComponent after you select the component.
