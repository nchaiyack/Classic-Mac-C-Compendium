The purpose of this is to allow you to EVALUATE Tools Plus before buying it. There are, however, terms and conditions to using this product, even for the purpose of evaluation. For full details, please read the remainder of this document.Why an “Evaluation Kit” instead of a demo?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The Tools Plus Evaluation Kit is a method of software distribution that gives you an opportunity to try Tools Plus before buying it. It has ALL the features of our commercially distributed software. Demos, on the other hand, offer limited functionality or they are crippled in some way. We believe the best way to evaluate Tools Plus is to try it for yourself in real-life situations. You just can’t do that with a demo.  You should always buy software that suits your requirements and budget. This Evaluation Kit makes it easier to determine if Tools Plus suits your needs, because you can try it before you buy it. You have the ultimate money-back guarantee: if you don’t use Tools Plus, you don’t pay for it!  During your evaluation, you may use Tools Plus to develop and create applications without charge or obligation for up to thirty (30) days, but you may NOT distribute Tools Plus or application’s written with Tools Plus. Please read this entire document for full details on conditions and terms.  Tools Plus is COMMERCIAL software. Copyright laws apply, and Water’s Edge Software (the copyright holder) retains all rights with a few exceptions as specifically stated............................................................................................................................................                   SOFTWARE LICENSE & LIMITED WARRANTY                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  In order to preserve and protect its rights under applicable law, Water’s Edge Software (the author and distributor) does not sell any rights in its SOFTWARE.
