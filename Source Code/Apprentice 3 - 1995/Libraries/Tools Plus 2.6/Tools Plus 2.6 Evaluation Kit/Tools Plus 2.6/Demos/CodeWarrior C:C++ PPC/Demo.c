/*********************************************************************************** *	Tools Plus	--	D e m o   P r o g r a m	--	(Version 2.6) *	Copyright (c) 1994-95 Water's Edge Software *	Designed and programmed by Steve Makohin * *	All files in this project use the Monaco 9pt. *	This application is written as a single source file (ie: I deliberately did NOT *	split it into units) to simplify compiling for programmers that are just *	starting out.  It also demonstrates that programming with Tools Plus makes *	source code compact and readable. * *	If you are put off by the size of this program, please note that it is *	H E A V I L Y   C O M M E N T E D and it is not optimized, both of which were *	done to facilitate the teaching of Tools Plus. * *	Though you will likely be able to figure out what each line of source code does, *	extensive comments are provided so you won't have to constantly refer to the *	Tools Plus User Manual and Inside Macintosh. *	R e s o u r c e s : *	This demo uses resources that can be found in the "Demo Resources" file.  The *	following describes each of the resources and what function they perform in this *	application.  You can add, change, delete and view resources by using a resource *	editor application such as Apple's ResEdit. * *	Type     ID    Description *	----  -------  ----------- *	acur		128	   Animated Cursor definition:  Tells Tools Plus how to animate the *                 cursor to create a wrist watch with a spinning second hand.  The *                 'acur' resource specifies the sequence of cursor resources *                 ('CURS') that will be used for the animation, and the time taken *                 between steps.  See the User Manual for details. * *	BNDL		128    Bundle Resource:  This resource tells the Finder which icons are *                 used to depict the application and the documents created by it. *                 The BNDL resource bundles the following related resources: FREF, *                 icl4, icl8, ICN#, and 'TP 1' * *	cicn		- -		 Color Icons (definable size):  This is the first color icon format *								 available on color (Mac II) Macintoshes.  Each 'cicn' includes a *								 color image, the equivalent black and white image, and a mask.  In *								 this demo, all 'cicn' icons were created using 4-bit colors to *								 ensure that they look good when displayed on monitors set to *								 16-colors/grays or higher. *				300-303  These color icons (hard disk, floppy, and folder) show up in the *								 Pop-Up Menus demo beside menu item names. *				304,305	 These "large" color icons (printer and modem) appear in "picture *								 Pop-Up Menus" (picture in a Pop-Up Menu without any text).  There *								 are 'ICON' equivalents for these items for Macs without Color *								 QuickDraw. *				430-441	 These "tape deck" buttons are used in the Picture Buttons demo to *								 show you the look you can get with Tools Plus's buttons.  Each *								 button requires two icons, one for the button's normal state, and *								 one for the selected (pushed in) state.  I know, they don't behave *								 like a real tape deck, but this is only a demo. *				460,461  This bi-directional "globe" button is used in the Picture Buttons *								 demo.  The two icons show the button in its normal state, and in *								 its selected (pushed in) state. *				464,465	 This "Done" button is used in the Picture Buttons demo.  The two *								 icons show the button in its normal state, and in its selected *								 (pushed in) state.  Even the most ordinary buttons can look *								 sophisticated with Tools Plus. *				520-541	 These are all used in the Floating Palettes demo to create *								 clickable icons.  You can create professional looking palettes *								 with various styles of buttons using Tools Plus. * *	CURS	128-134  Cursors:  These cursors are used to produce an animated cursor. *                 The 'acur' resource specified which cursors are used, and the *                 animation's speed.  See the User Manual for details. * *	FREF		128    Finder Reference:  This resource is automatically created when a *                 BNDL resource is created.  One FREF exists for each icon that the *                 Finder references.  This demo is an application (file type is *                 'APPL'), so one FREF is needed for that.  If this demo had the *                 ability to create three different kinds of documents, then one *                 FREF would be required for each kind type of document. * *	icl4		- -		 Large (32x32 pixel) 4-bit Icons:  These icons are typically used *                 only by the Finder to depict an application and its related *                 files.  However, your application can also draw these icons with *                 Tools Plus.  4-bit icons can have a maximum of 16 colors. *					0,1,2	 These "large" color icons appear in "picture Pop-Up Menus" *								 (picture in a Pop-Up Menu without any text).  There are 'ICON' *								 equivalents for these items for Macs without Color QuickDraw. *								 These color icons will be used on color monitors as a substitute *                 for the system's Stop, Note and Caution icons.  They give color *                 applications a better look. *					128		 Application's Icon (displayed by the Finder.  The BNDL resource *                 refers to this icon) *					150		 Printer icon used to demonstrate drawing icon families *					151		 Modem icon used to demonstrate drawing icon families *				400,401	 Left Arrow button used in Picture Buttons demo (part of an icl8 / *								 icl4 / ICN# family).  One icon is used for the button's standard *								 position, and another for the selected (pushed in) position. *				402,403	 Right Arrow button used in Picture Buttons demo (similar to above) *				420-425	 Plus/Minus button used in Picture Buttons demo.  These 4 icons are *								 used in a particularly attractive button.  The top half (+) *								 darkens when you select it, and so does the bottom (-). Two icons *								 (standard and selected position) are used for the top half, and *								 two for the bottom. These icons are part of an icl8 / icl4 / ICN# *								 family. *				450-456	 Four icons are used to draw a dual-stage button (Power-On / *								 Power-Off) in the Picture Buttons demo; a pair for each stage, one *								 for the standard state and one for the selected (pushed in) state. *								 An additional pair of icons ause used to portray the buttons as *								 disabled; one for Power-On and one for Power-Off.  These icons are *								 part of an icl8 / icl4 / ICN# family. * *	icl8		- -		 Large (32x32 pixel) 8-bit Icons:  These icons are typically used *                 only by the Finder to depict an application and its related *                 files.  However, your application can also draw these icons with *                 Tools Plus.  8-bit icons can have a maximum of 256 colors. *					1,2    These color icons will be used on color monitors as a substitute *                 for the system's Note and Caution icons.  They give color *                 applications a better look.  Notice that there isn't a Stop icon *                 (ID=0).  The equivalent icl4 will be used instead. *					128		 Application's Icon (displayed by the Finder.

In this case, they are exactly the same *                 as System 7's system icons, but they are included in case this *                 application runs on System 5 (where the system icons are *                 different).  There are color counterparts for these icons (icl4 *                 and icl8). * *				304,305	 These printer and modem icons appear in "picture Pop-Up Menus" *								 (picture in a Pop-Up Menu without any text) on Macs without Color *								 QuickDraw.  There are 'cicn' equivalents for these items for Macs *								 with Color QuickDraw. * *	ics4		- -		 Small (16x16 pixel) 4-bit Icons:  These icons are typically used *                 only by the Finder to depict an application and its related *                 files.  4-bit icons can have a maximum of 16 colors. *					128		 Application's Icon (displayed by the Finder.

The BNDL resource *                 refers to this icon) * *	ics#		- -		 Small (16x16 pixel) 1-bit Icons:  These icons are typically used *                 only by the Finder to depict an application and its related *                 files.  1-bit icons are black & white. *					128		 Application's Icon (displayed by the Finder.  The BNDL resource *                 refers to this icon) * *	PICT		- -		 Pictures of any dimension, number of colors (including gray scale *                 and black & white) *					128		 Black & white (1-bit) picture.  It's the black & white equivalent *                 of resource 129 *					129		 Color (8-bit) picture.  It's the color equivalent of resource *                 128. *				150-173	 Complete picture suite needed for a 2-stage button. Each stage *								 (value) can be either or not, and includes different PICTs for *								 screen depths of 8-bits, 4-bits, and B&W. They also include a *								 mask, though this is not necessary when drawing on a white *								 background. * *  SICN		- -		 Small (16x16 pixel) 1-bit Icons:  These icons are "indexed", *								 meaning that you can have multiple icon images in a single 'SICN' *								 resource. *				300-303	 These color icons (hard disk, floppy, and folder) show up in the *								 Pop-Up Menus demo beside menu item names. They are supplied *								 because Macs without Color QuickDraw need SICNs (they can't use *								 color 'cicn' icons). *				408-414  These are all used in the Picture Buttons demo to create 3D icons. *								 Tools Plus converts an SICN icon into a color 3D button. *					458		 These are all used in the Picture Buttons demo to create 3D icons. *								 Tools Plus converts an SICN icon into a color 3D button.  Because *								 this SICN resource has several images, each image becomes an *								 available "state" (or usable value).  In this example, the user *								 can step through the stages by clicking on the button. *				500-519	 These are all used in the Floating Palettes demo to create 3D *								 icons.  Tools Plus converts an SICN icon into a color 3D button. *								 You can create professional looking palettes with different styles *								 of buttons using Tools Plus. * *	SIZE		-1     Multi-tasking info:  The 'SIZE' resource is needed if your *                 application is going to run under MultiFinder (System 5 and 6) *                 or System 7.  It tells the Macintosh how your application should *                 behave in a multi-tasking environment.  See the User Manual for *                 details. * *	TP 1		128		 Owner Resource:  This resource is automatically created when a *                 BNDL resource is created. This demo's signature is 'TP 1', and as *                 you may recall, each application must have a unique signature *                 code (see the User Manual for details).  That signature code is *                 used to create an "owner resource" whose resource type is the *                 same as the application's signature code. * *	vers		- -		 Application Version:  These resources' information is displayed *                 in the Finder's Get Info box. *					1      This information is displayed at the bottom of the Get Info box. *                 It includes an application version number and the copyright info. *					2      This information is displayed at the top of the Get Info box.  It *                 is a comment that is displayed beneath the application's name *                 (ie: "Tools Plus demo"). * *	WDEF		- -		 Window Definition:  WDEFs define how a window looks.  If you want *                 to open a window that is not one of the six standard Macintosh *                 window types, you have to create a window definition. *					2000	 Pallet Window:  These windows have a narrow title bar, and are *                 typically used as "floating windows" (they are always active, and *                 they float above your other windows).  This demo has several *                 floating pallets. *	T h e   D e m o s : *	This demo application can be used as a framework for a new application, although *  you will probably want to improve upon it to cater to your own programming style *  and needs.  The demo can be broken down into several sections: * *		main					The main program demonstrates a typical application's startup *                  and response to events. * *	PrepareTheDemo	This routine creates the demos menus and opens a couple demo *                  windows. * *		Window 1			This window demonstrates how Tools Plus works with… *										• List Boxes *										• Buttons (radio buttons, check boxes and push buttons) *										• Cursor Zones * *		Window 2			This window demonstrates how Tools Plus works with… *										• Editing Fields (typing, Cut, Copy, Paste, Clear, and Undo. *										  Tabbing to next / prev field) *										• Scroll Bars *										• "Size box" and the "zoom box" (changing a window's size) * *		Window 3			This window demonstrates how Tools Plus works with… *										• drawing icon families *										• Cursor Zones used to make icons click sensitive * *		Window 4			This window shows off Tools Plus's cursor animation, and how *									Tools Plus behaves when a watch cursor is displayed. * *		Window 5			This window demonstrates how to write code for color drawing *									that is dependent on the monitor's settings (ie: number of *									colors, number of shades of gray, or black & white).  It also *									shows how to write code that is compatible with Macintoshes that *									have multiple monitors. * *		Window 6			This demo shows off Tools Plus's Dynamic Alerts.  They are alert *									boxes that automatically adjust to accommodate the text your *									application provides them. * *		Window 7			This window demonstrates Tools Plus's Pop-Up Menus and some of *									the features you can incorporate into them. * *		Window 8			This window features Tools Plus's Picture Buttons, which *									transform icons or pictures into powerful buttons.  Picture *									Buttons have a list of properties that you can select and combine *									to create your own custom Picture Buttons.  Picture Button *									properties control the look and behavior of the button. * *		Window 9			Window 9 is this application's Tool Bar.  Tools Plus lets you *									create a Tool Bar as easily as any other Tools Plus window.  You *									can put any control you want in the Tool Bar, including picture *									buttons (the most common thing), pop-up menus, and editing fields. *									Demo Window 8 describes picture buttons in greater detail. * *		Window 10			Window 10 is this a floating palette.  Tools Plus lets you create *									a floating palette as easily as any other Tools Plus window. *									You can put any control you want in the Tool Bar, including *									picture buttons (the most common thing), pop-up menus, and *									editing fields.  Demo Window 8 describes picture buttons in *									greater detail. * *		Window 11			Window 11 is this also a floating palette (like demo window 10), *									except this is a horizontal palette with the title bar along the *									window's left side. *	S o u n d   M a n a g e r : *	This demo uses the Sound Manager just for entertainment's sake.
