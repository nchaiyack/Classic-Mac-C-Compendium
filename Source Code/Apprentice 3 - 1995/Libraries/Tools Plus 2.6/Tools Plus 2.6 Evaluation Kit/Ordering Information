Evaluating & Ordering Tools Plus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you find Tools Plus useful and continue to use it beyond the thirty (30) day free evaluation period, you are required to register (purchase) Tools Plus.  Please see the “Evaluation License & Legal Info” document for details.

When you register Tools Plus, you will receive these special benefits:
   √ License to continue using Tools Plus after the thirty day
      evaluation period has expired
   √ The latest version of Tools Plus on a disk
   √ Libraries that are more compact (when compiled) and
       memory-efficient
   √ A printed 250-page User Manual -- It has pictures, illustrations,
       programming tips, and an index that are not included in this
       condensed documentation. The printed manual is also much
       easier to use than a set of text files.
   √ A floating palette WDEF that features a full color drag bar (just
       like commercial applications)
   √ Free PROMPT technical support
   √ Free software updates
   √ Major software upgrades at reduced prices

Free Software Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Until recently, Tools Plus updates and major upgrades have been available only by sending disks through conventional mail. We will continue to offer this service.

We can also send you software updates electronically (by email). To be capable of receiving updates electronically from Water’s Edge Software, you must have the necessary email components and software as detailed below:



(1) You need an Email Account

--- eWorld ---
If you have an eWorld account, we can send you a compressed archive by way of a file enclosure in an eWorld Mail message. When receiving such an enclosure, you pay only for connect-time with eWorld. A typical update will take less than five minutes with a 9600 bps modem.

--- CompuServe ---
If you have a CompuServe account, we can send you a compressed archive by way of a file enclosure in a CompuServe Mail message. Unfortunately, CompuServe charges its mail users by the _volume_ of information sent or received. For this reason, we will send only small updates (at our own cost) by way of a file enclosure in a CompuServe Mail message.

Very large upgrades (enclosures as large as 1MB) will be sent as “split cost” (shared cost by sender and receiver)! You will receive a separate CompuServe Mail message describing the update, so you can decide if you want to receive the large file or delete it without paying for it.

--- Internet and Other Email Systems ---
Your email account must be capable of receiving large messages, often larger than 100K, and sometimes exceeding 1MB (or 1000K). Some email systems segment incoming mail into smaller chunks (usually of less than 32K) and require that the message be reassembled before it is decoded and decompressed.  AOL and AppleLink are examples of such systems.

If you are running a “pure” Internet account (or have access to one), it may be as simple as using a different application for your email to prevent segmentation, such as Eudora (a shareware email app that can send and receive very large enclosures).  Alternatively, you can ask your email administrator to increase the file size threshold at which enclosures become segmented.



(2) You need BinHex and decompression software

When sent by Internet, our updates are compressed by StuffIt Deluxe and encoded with BinHex 4.0 (to allow transmission on a text-only medium such as Internet).

Recipients of these updates will need an application that can decode the BinHexed file and decompress it. An excellent application that does just this is Aladdin System’s “StuffIt Expander.” The latest version is 3.0.7, and it is available as freeware from most bulletin boards.

When sent to CompuServe or eWorld accounts, our updates are compressed by StuffIt Deluxe (they are not BinHexed since CIS and eWorld allow enclosure of binary files). StuffIt Expander will do an excellent job at decompressing these archives.
