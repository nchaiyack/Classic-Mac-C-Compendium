Drag Manager & PlayerPRO

PlayerPRO is now able to use the new Drag Manager (you need system 7.5 or the "Macintosh Drag and Drop" Extension by Apple). This new Drag Manager will increase the capabilities of PlayerPRO to manage your musics!

This new feature will enable you to work faster and better. For example:
- You can save your tracks directly on your disk by dragging&dropping a selection of the digital editor.
- You directly press on a note of the piano window and drag&drop it on a cell of the digital editor.
- You can directly drop instrument files from the Finder into the Instrument window.
- And much more...
