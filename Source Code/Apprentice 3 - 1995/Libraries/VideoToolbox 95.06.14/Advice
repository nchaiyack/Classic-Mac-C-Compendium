VideoToolbox:Advice
June 14, 1995

The entire VideoToolbox (with a few inconsequential exceptions) now runs native
on the PowerPC. We're very happy with the PowerMac 6100 (about $2,000, academic,
with an AV card and CD-ROM drive) and the very similar Workgroup Server 6150/66
(similar pricing but comes with 16 MB memory and 700 MB hard disk) and the
Metrowerks CodeWarrior Gold C compiler ($99 academic). (To run CodeWarrior you'll
need a CD-ROM drive, and you'll want to have at least 16 MB memory and 300 MB
disk.) The compiler and your code both run native and fast! I'm expecting to
stock my new lab with the forthcoming Catalyst Macs. Our 68k Macs now seem
unbearably slow.

Advice to beginners,

If you want to do vision experiments on your Macintosh computer, and haven’t
programmed a Mac before, there are various things you should get for yourself.
I’ve listed what I consider essential. The stuff I use. There are lots of baby
books that hold your hand while you learn, but the ones that I’ve looked at
weren’t helpful for setting up vision experiments. They’re oriented towards
producing Mac-like applications with the right look and feel, which is
unimportant when the experimenter is the only person that will ever run the
program. Be warned that the bible, Inside Macintosh, is intimidating at first.
The classic comment about Inside Mac is that you have to have read the rest to
understand any part. Fortunately, the second edition is much more readily
assimilable. Mac programming is tough going at first, but I’ve come to like it,
as the Apple routines are generally intelligent solutions to complicated
problems. Anyway, by looking at the sources for the various demos in the
VideoToolbox you should be able to get going much more quickly than I did. Good
luck. -Denis Pelli, denis@xp.psych.nyu.edu

NOTE: the archive addresses that appear throughout this document, e.g.
"ftp://...", are in a standard format called "URL" (Uniform Resource Locator)
that most internet programs now prefer. To retrieve files from a URL, I recommend
Anarchie, which you can download from here:
 ftp://ftp.tidbits.com//pub/tidbits/tisk/tcp/anarchie-15.hqx
TidBITS magazine says, "URLs constitute the most common and efficient method of
telling people where to find objects available via FTP, the World-Wide Web, and
other Internet services. You can specify URLs not only for files and Web pages,
but also for stranger things, such as email addresses, Telnet sessions, and
Usenet news postings."

ESSENTIAL BOOKS AND SOFTWARE:

The C Programming Language, Second Edition
by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, Prentice Hall, 1988
This book describes the new Standard C, which most commercial compilers conform to.

Metrowerks CodeWarrior C Compiler on CD-ROM
The CodeWarrior C compiler, first released in January '94, is now at version 6.1
(June '95), and deservedly gets rave reviews. It's very popular. The Gold
version supports both 680x0 and PowerPC. They copied most of what Symantec THINK
C did right, and then added their own improvements. There are two flavors: Bronze
$99 generates 680x0 code only; Gold $399 ($99 academic) generates both 680x0 and
PowerPC code. The not-yet-available Platinum ($499, $99 academic) will generate
680x0, PowerPC, and Intel x86/Pentium code. (The academic price is a great deal:
$99!) New versions are issued 3 times a year; the purchase price includes one
year of updates. (Major updates are published as CD-ROMs; minor updates are
distributed only by email, and posted on the internet.) It comes without any
paper documentation; it's all on the CD-ROM, which you can print yourself, but I
prefer to buy the printed and bound manual: "Inside CodeWarrior 6" book $34.95.
     Metrowerks has been very responsive in accepting bug reports (issuing bug
numbers and promises to fix) and suggestions (which they forward to engineering
with no promises). Each subsequent release has fixed most of the bugs I'd
reported, and incorporated many of my suggestions. Unfortunately Metrowerks
doesn't publish a bug list. (I've suggested it several times, to no avail.)
     My current (version CW6.1) complaints are minor. If you include a .pch file
in your project and do a Make, it is often re-precompiled unnecessarily, e.g.
after you Remove Binaries (Bug No. BR5043). Sending the character '\r' to stdout,
e.g. printf("Hello.\r"), doesn't force an update of the SIOUX console, as '\n'
does. fflush(stdout) moves the console insertion point to the end of the line and
discards pending keyboard input. The 68k debugger says "Bus Error" if you try to
access video RAM (Bug No. BR4705). On PowerPC the long double type is supposed to
be 16-byte, but is actually implemented as 8-byte (i.e. a double), making it
incompatible with Apple's long double math library (Bug No. BR4547). CodeWarrior
does not recognize the nonstandard "%#s" printf format, which is used by MPW and
THINK C to print pascal strings, so you have to convert your pascal string to a C
string before printing it.
     The following bugs that I found in prior versions were fixed in CW6. The 
debugger no longer interferes with the use of GetNextEvent(). The PowerPC
debugger is (finally!) compatible with the new version (1.52) of RAM Doubler.
(The CW6 release note "MW Debug 1.2 notes" says the ppc debugger is "not
compatible" with RAM Doubler, but that was before version 1.52. The
incompatibility was actually out of Metrowerks's hands, it was an incompatibility
between RAM Doubler and Apple's DebugServices, which Metrowerks ppc debugger
uses. You must use RAM Doubler 1.52 or later, and DebugServices 2.0b14 or later,
which comes with CW6.)
      The following bugs that I found in prior versions were fixed in CW5.5. The
CW5 console had a status line that you couldn't entirely get rid of. The
predefined compiler macro __option(fourbyteints) didn't work (Bug No. BR4702).
     The following bugs that I found in prior versions were fixed in CW5.
Assignment of structs larger than 32 KB didn't work (Bug No. BR4516). The
built-in console printed both linefeed and return as linefeed (Bug No. T509).
When the program asked for input from stdin, the user had to manually select the
console window if it wasn't already frontmost. iscntrl(0) returned 0 (Bug No.
BR4415). I was also happy to find several of my suggestions incorporated in CW5:
more console options, automatic re-precompilation (via .pch files), and checking
that the current compiler settings are consistent with those of the pre-compiled
header.
     The following bugs that I found in prior versions were fixed in version
CW4.5. The compiler generated bad code for the assignment a[i][j][k][!m]=1 (Bug
No. BR4183). Enum char arguments failed to be promoted (to int) when the
corresponding parameter was untyped (e.g. in printf) (Bug No. T517). In the
2-byte-int version of the Standard C library, the functions memset and calloc
crashed if asked to zero more than 64KB (Reference Nos. ES7266 and ES7268). The
console failed to print characters with ascii codes higher than 127 (Bug No.
T467), and crashed if asked to backspace '/b' beyond the left margin (Bug No.
T513).

Power Macintosh Programming Starter Kit
by Tom Thompson, Hayden Books, 1994
(I haven't seen this book, but the following review seems promising. dgp) "A
good introduction to MetroWerk's CodeWarrior, the other best programming
environment for the mac, the only one to use if you're building PPC code, and my
current favorite. The enclosed CD has a limited version of CodeWarrior (you can
only work on the projects included in the disc - can't create new ones), and
example code. Covers a lot of toolbox issues that are not explored in other
introductory books and the PPC architecture in detail. Assumes working knowledge
of C, and the toolbox." (Book review posted on cwarrior@netcom.com by
nick@pitt.edu).

Macintosh Programmer's Toolbox Assistant
$89.95 from APDA or Addison-Wesley. An online reference manual summarizing most
of the information in the Inside Mac books. Similar to THINK Reference but newer
and therefore more up to date. Requires 25 MB disk space. Even if you have the
Inside Mac books (paper or CD-ROM) you'll still want this or THINK Reference to
quickly look up details while you're programming. (It's included in the Apple
Developer Mailing, below.) Highly recommended.

THINK Reference 2
$129 from Symantec. An online reference manual summarizing most of the
information in the Inside Mac books, volumes I-VI. Requires 8 MB disk space.
ftp://devtools.symantec.com/DTS Server Drive /ftp/Macintosh/Updates/DevTools/THINK-Ref-2.0.1-Updater.sit

Numerical Recipes In C Set for Macintosh, 2nd ed.

Inside Macintosh, 2nd edition: Imaging with QuickDraw, Advanced Color Imaging, ...
Inside Macintosh CD-ROM $89.95 (includes 25 books in electronic form).
Designing Cards and Drivers, 3rd edition
(OBSOLETE: Inside Macintosh, 1st ed.: Volumes I to VI)
From Addison-Wesley or APDA (addresses at end of this file).
You’ll need these books, especially "Imaging with QuickDraw" and "Advanced Color
Imaging". The 2nd edition of Inside Macintosh is significantly easier to read
than the first (which is now obsolete) and includes examples in C, not just
Pascal. (As of December '94, a draft of "Advanced Color Imaging" has appeared on
the Developer CD, but hasn't yet appeared in printed form.) The CD-ROM is a good
deal, offering a cheap way to have all the books on hand.

Symantec THINK C 7/8
I used THINK C until mid 1994, but I no longer recommend it. (For another
perspective, see "On the other hand" below.) Unsupported software isn't
appropriate for serious work. THINK C 7/8 is a C compiler and programming
environment (combined editor, linker, librarian, loader) for 68k Macintoshes
only. (Versions 7 and 8 are identical except for the version number.) THINK C was
very good, but it seems that Symantec has stopped supporting it in favor of their
C++. For more money you can get Symantec C++ for Macintosh or Power PC, both of
which include THINK C 8 and Apple's universal headers as part of the package.
THINK C is only for 68k Macs. Symantec C++ for PowerPC includes a new PowerPC C
compiler, which seems to be unrelated to the THINK C compiler. Thus it appears
that Symantec's C compilers for 68k and ppc have different heritages, which seems
undesirable since I would have very little confidence that the compiled code
would run identically. (In my lab we routinely produce fat applications and run
them on whichever computer is available.) VideoToolbox is pure C, and makes no
use of C++. The upgrade (see below) from THINK C 6 to 8 is free, but doesn't
include the universal headers.
     Version 8 of THINK C is hardly changed from version 6. Version 7 slightly
enhanced the user interface of the Symantec Project Manager, and fixed a few bugs
in the THINK C compiler. Version 8 is unchanged from Version 7. (There are a few
extra things--AppleScript support and Apple's Universal Headers--that are useful
to THINK C users, but which you'll get only if you pay for the full Symantec C++
8 package.) In a pinch, you can use THINK C 5, but the upgrade from 5 to 8 is
inexpensive and improves the user interface significantly. It appears that
Symantec is basically dropping THINK C, since it hasn't changed (significantly)
since version 5, and since they haven't announced any plans to port it to the
PowerPC. (I've also heard that none of the authors work for them any longer.)
Symantec is concentrating on C++ (which is based on Zortech C++, not THINK C).
     Since 1993, my experience trying to give Symantec bug reports about THINK C has
been discouraging. In THINK C 7.03, 7.04, and 8, on a PowerBook 170, if you
evaluate exp(log(0.5)) you get INF, not 0.5 as you'd expect. (CodeWarrior gives
the right answer. The problem seems to be specific to THINK C on the PowerBook
170.) I reported the bug on July 11, and 20, 1994, but Symantec didn't
acknowledge that it's a bug and apparently will never fix it.
     ON THE OTHER HAND: Lew Harvey, lharvey@clipr.colorado.edu, writes "Dear Denis, I
was just reading your advice file in the latest VideoToolbox and think that you
are being too harsh on Symantec. I think their C compiler is great. It is my
understanding that Symantec is not abandoning C in favor of C++ and is making
continual improvements in both. I think it is true that they are putting a lot of
effort into C++, but since the ANSI standard libraries are written in C, they
still depend on a good C compiler. I have found them quite responsive to my
reporting of bugs in both the C and C++ 68k compilers. In any case I am very
happy with the development environment. From the comments I've read in various
newsgroups, I conclude that the Symantec C++ development environment is superior
to CW in several ways, including the handling of exceptions, Visual Architect and
the TCL class library. (I don't own stock in Symantec!)." [Note that Denis used
THINK C until 1994, while Lew is using Symantec C++, which appeared about then,
so the two views are compatible.]
     Lew adds, "There is a confusion around about names for the compilers and the
project managers. Symantec is using the following naming scheme to distinguish
the various compilers and the processors they produce code for. To produce
PowerPC code: Symantec Project Manager 8.0.1, PowerPC C (C compiler) 8.0.1,
PowerPC C++ (C++ compiler) 8.0.1. To produce 68k Code: Think Project Manager
7.0.4, Think C (C compiler) 8.0, Symantec C++ (C++ compiler) 8.0"
THINK C 6 $299
Symantec C++ 7 for Macintosh $499
Symantec C++ 8 for Power Macintosh $499
Upgrade to C++ 8 $149.95 for registered users of Symantec C++ 7,THINK C,or Pascal.

MPW Pro
(Macintosh Programmer's Workbench, Professional Edition)
$495  ($295 to upgrade from MPW) from APDA (address at end of this document).
This is a new package from Apple, providing a complete development environment
(C, Pascal, and Assembler; 68k and PowerPC) on one CD-ROM. Apparently it's the
same CD-ROM that you would get by subscribing to ETO (minus Symantec C++),
without the printed manuals. Most people find MPW slow and clumsy, and prefer
CodeWarrior. (The only thing I use MPW for is CompareFiles.) However,
Apple includes pre-release tools on their ETO disks that might be handy.

Essential Tools and Objects CD-ROM (also called “ETO”)
$1,095 for first year, $400/year thereafter. ($300 credit for owners of MPW or
MPW Pro.) from APDA.
I don’t subscribe to this--it seems too expensive--but you may want to. It’s
updated 3 times a year and has the latest versions of Apple’s development tools,
MPW, C, etc. It includes MPW Pro, Symantec C++, and 21 printed manuals. Doesn't
include the Developer Mailings. (The important difference between MPW Pro and
ETO is that ETO is a subscription so they keep sending you the latest disk, 3
times a year, whereas you buy MPW Pro once, no updates.)

ONLINE SERVICES:

Who can answer your Macintosh programming question? You can try posting it on
UseNet or Compuserve. Somebody knowledgeable might jump in. (Apple engineers
often participate in UseNet, occasionally in CompuServe.) If you sell a
commercial Mac product you may qualify to become an Apple Partner. For
$1,500/year, Apple engineers will answer your questions by email, provided you've
already consulted the relevant manuals.

UseNet
The comp.sys.mac.programming.codewarrior UseNet news group has knowledgeable
active discussion. Experts often jump in with helpful answers to thorny
questions. You can participate in UseNet from your your Mac using telnet (NCSA
Telnet and MacIP are both free) to log into a local unix system. Or you might
use InterNews (available by ftp from the Info-Mac archive) if you can get tcp/ip
access to a net news server.

CompuServe Information Service

If you can’t join UseNet, then you may want to join CompuServe, to follow the
discussions and post your seemingly insoluble Macintosh problems on the bulletin
boards, MacPro, MacDev, or Symantec:THINK C, to get free advice from experts.
Buy the program Navigator from CompuServe, as it makes CompuServe much easier to
use. You’ll need a modem. A new wrinkle is that CompuServe offers dialup PPP
access to the internet, which may be a cost-effective way of accessing your
mail when you're on the road.

ALINK.MGMT@applelink.apple.com
AppleLink is Apple’s original bulletin board and email system. It provides some
system software updates and technical information. Most companies that make
Macintosh products have AppleLink accounts, and you can use the online directory
to get their email addresses. You’ll need a modem. During spring 1995 AppleLink
is supposed to be phased out in favor of eWorld. I've tried eWorld, but so far
(3/95) I haven't found eWorld useful. Apple has just announced that they will
provide one-day-turnaround free customer support on eWorld, which may make it
worth subscribing.

Anyone can submit a bug report to APPLE.BUGS@Applelink.Apple.com. They prefer,
but don’t require, the format produced automatically by a hypercard stack 
called Apple Bug Reporter, which can be downloaded from:

SOFTWARE ARCHIVES ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE INTERNET:

FTP is a file transfer protocol used to transfer files across the Internet. FTP
programs typically have very rudimentary user interfaces. Some of the bigger ftp
servers are now also Gopher servers. Gopher (developed at University of
Minnesota, originally for a campus-wide information server)  is sort of a
superset of ftp that provides a quite good user interface and allows access to a
wide variety of Internet resources. Public ftp servers require that you log in
as “anonymous and will accept any password, but it is considered a courtesy to
supply your electronic address as the password. If for some reason you can’t use
ftp or gopher, some of the sites will help you out by allowing you to request
transmission of files to you by email.

There are two ways to use ftp from your Mac. The traditional, indirect, approach
is to remotely log into a mainframe (preferably one running unix), use its ftp
facilities to move the file to it, and then download the file from it. The
modern, direct, approach requires that your AppleTalk network have a gateway to
the Internet, so that you can run an ftp program on your Mac (provided you have
Apple’s MacTCP init, included in System 7.5). I recommend Anarchie, TurboGopher,
Mosaic, or Netscape for downloading and Fetch 2.1 for uploading. All are free
from the Info-Mac archive.

The Internet Starter Kit for Macintosh, 2nd edition, by Adam C. Engst. If you're
starting from zero, this book includes a free disk that has MacTCP and lots of
other important utilities for accessing the Internet. Published by Hayden Books.

HARDWARE:

The Power Mac 6100 is great for vision research. Its university price is about
$2,000, and its two built-in video ports (with the optional AV board) are very
fast; as fast as the fastest Quadra. We don't need any slots. If you want slots,
you may want to wait to until summer 1995 when Power Macs with PCI slots are
scheduled to appear. The PCI bus is fast and is quickly becoming the bus of
choice for Intel-based computers, so there will soon be a huge array of cards to
choose from. (Making a PCI card compatible with both PowerPC and Intel
processors will require a bigger "plug and play" ROM, but it seems likely that
most manufacturers will take the trouble.) I suggest you get the built-in CD-ROM
(most developer information now comes only on CD-ROM disks) and get 16 MB of
memory, since it makes programming easier.

In my experience a plain old (now obsolete) Mac II is fast enough for many
things, but faster Macs can show bigger movies. So far we’ve never needed more
than 8-bit color, making the obsolete Apple Toby and TFB video cards our
favorites for NuBus, because they work perfectly (unlike Apple’s 1992 crop of
video cards--see the "Video synch" and "Video bugs" documents), and they’re
available for $125 from Shreve Systems, 800-227-3971, but, of course, they don’t
support the latest large monitors. We also like the built-in video on all of
Apple’s newer computers because you can load images into them at extremely high
speeds (try the demo TimeVideo), since they bypass the NuBus bottleneck. We use
the mouse or keyboard to collect observer responses. We’ve bought a few Data
Translation A/D boards to automate our photometry, moving the cards from machine
to machine as needed, but they are probably not the best brand.

You’ll need a modem to call CompuServe or AppleLink, and to dial in from home and
elsewhere using AppleTalk Remote Access (ARA). 28,800 bits/s modems cost several
hundred dollars. (I'm happy with the 14k b/s Global Village modem in my
PowerBook, but I'm planning to upgrade to a PowerPC PowerBook with a 28.8 kb/s
Global Village modem as soon as they're available.) Phone lines are still
expensive though, so you may want to cost-share by using a shared modem and a
single phone line, in which case you'll want to buy an AppleTalk Remote Access
server to connect the modem to your AppleTalk network.

My department uses a single DAT tape drive (with compression, from APS) and the
Retrospect program to backup dozens of Macs every night automatically. We’re
very happy with it. Retrospect maintains a historical backup so you can go back

At $30 per megabyte it’s worth buying enough memory to take your computer up to
at least 8 MB. (To show movies, we've taken several of our computers up to 24 or
40 MB.) This outfit has good prices.

MONITORS:

We’ve done nearly all our research using Apple’s High Resolution Monochrome
monitors, which are inexpensive and adequate, though one could wish for higher
luminance (100 cd/m^2 peak when new), better high voltage regulation, and dc
coupling instead of dc restoration. I suspect that a color monitor might be
better regulated and might be excellent used as a monochrome monitor. Use with
the ISR Video Attenuator would require that you: 1. use only the green channel,
or 2. build a video amplifier to drive all three channels from the single output
of the video attenuator, or 3. snip two of the 75 ohm termination resistors
inside the monitor and tie all three channels together.

Here's what I know about high-frame rate and bright monitors. (Fast and bright
are both interesting, separately and together.) Does anybody have anything to
add?

A company called Dotronix is supposed to be coming out with a high resolution
(150 MHz) bright (300 cd/m^2) 21" multisynch gray scale monitor (ASM2400 21"FS)
for about $1450. Dotronix (715) 834-7785.

I know very little about color monitors, but people keep asking me to recommend
one. Tom Robson of Cambridge Research Systems gave me a brochure for what
appears to be a rather nice color monitor: Sony 20-inch Trinitron Multiscan
GDM-2038. Field rate of 50 to 160 Hz. Max luminance 160 cd/m^2. Costs $2,500.

"We have new Sony GDM-2038 20" Trinitron monitors available at $1599 with a one
year warranty."

John Troy, jbtroy@casbah.acns.nwu.edu, writes, "We are using a Sony Trinitron
Color Display Multiscan. The model we use is the GDM-17SE1 (a 17" monitor). There
is a sister 20" monitor (GDM-20SE1) whose properties are presumably similar.
Although ours is a color monitor we have only used it so far as a white stimulus.
(We've made accurate measurements of chromaticity.) We run the refresh rate at
153 Hz (Line rate:  82.3 kHz, Dot rate: 108 MHz); the capacity to run this fast
was what attracted us to the monitor. [John is not using a Mac--he's using a
Cambridge Research Systems VSG board in a PC.] At that rate, in our hands, the
mean luminance is 82 cd m^-2. At that luminance with a 5 mm diameter pupil we
find that the cat ganglion cells we've studied so far resolve around 70-75 Hz; if
the screen luminance were higher, we'd need a faster frame rate to satisfy the
Nyquist criterion. According to the Sony spec-sheet, at 155.30 Hz the display has
640 dots X 480 lines (82 kHz line rate). We have currently only displayed
one-dimensional patterns (e.g., sinusoidal gratings, edges). We've achieved very
good control over stimulus contrast and accurate generation of sinewave gratings.
We are very satisfied with it. It was priced quite reasonably at $999."

We bought Apple's 17" Multiscan for about $900. It's a Sony Trinitron. Peak
luminance is about 100 cd/m^2. Using the Monitors control panel, or the new
Display Manager, you can select among several resolutions.

Does anyone know what the differences are between the Sony GDM-2038 and the
GDM-20SE1? They're both 20". Apple's 17" and 20" multiscan monitors are
made by Sony. Does anyone know whether they'll run at 150 Hz, like the
Sony GDM-2038 and the GDM-20SE1?

John Troy, jbtroy@casbah.acns.nwu.edu, writes, "I came across a new monitor,
Optiquest 2082DC, this weekend which might be better than the Sony.  It is a 20
inch color monitor with an advertised price of $1399. It has a 90 MHz dot rate.
Like the Sony, it has a shadow mask and various energy-saving features that may
be troublesome.  I don't have much information yet. Optiqest Inc., Walnut, CA
91789. (909)-468-3750."

Harry Orbach, horb@midway.uchicago.edu, writes "I have noticed that some monitors
(NEC  XP15,  XP17, XP21 and Panasonic  C1791E) are advertised in MacMall to run
at 160 Hz."

Mats Lind, mats.lind@cmd.uu.se, writes, "3-D Max, a Swedish company, working with
a Korean supplier, has just started to deliver attractively priced LCD-shutter
glasses and accessories giving binocular stereo capabilities to PCs. Their
product received enormous attention at the Ce-Bit fair in Hannover last week. The
estimated retail price in the US will be less than $180 USD (including some extra
software like 3-D games) and will probably reach a high market share. 3-D Max, is
very interested in entering the Apple market segment as well, but to do so
requires the usual 120+ Hz."

Tom Busey, busey@indiana.edu, adds, "I have just finished writing code that
displays color stereo 3-d pairs for use with LCD glasses. This code uses
sequential-frame presentations synched with LCD glasses controlled via the serial
port to provide the illusion of depth. While this technology is old, what is new
is my code takes two PICT files and reduces the millions of colors to what
amounts to 4 bits per red, green and blue channel for each picture (on monitors
with millions of colors) or 2 bits per channel for monitors with thousands of
colors. I add the two pictures together and I use clut switching to switch
between them. The stereo 3-d code uses calls from (not surprisingly) the
VideoToolbox code library. As with all the code I write, this code is freely
available to anyone who wants it. I'm currently working with LCD glasses
distributors to have it distributed free to purchasers of LCD glasses (which cost
about $150). The software may be downloaded from:"

COLLECTING ANALOG DATA:

"We use 2 setups to get data into the Macs:

"1. National Instruments has several analog i/o boards, and these can be
programmed directly or with a high-level language "LabView". Expensive, but
good. See upcoming paper in Vision Res for motion vep measurements where this
was used :-).

"2. "MacLab": Only 8 channels, box connects to scsi so any mac can be used, very
nice strip chard and scope applications. Much cheaper than labview, works right
away. For better analysis transfer to Igor or whatever is advised."

You may want to install a floating point emulator in your PowerPC. Native PowerPC
programs use the built-in FPU, but emulated 68K code normally cannot. These
emulators trap 68881 instructions and emulate them (rather slowly) on the PowerPC
chip.
•SoftwareFPU, available free from infomac. The free version is intended for 68k
Macs, and runs very slowly on the PowerPC. A PowerPC-native version is available
for $20. PowerFPU $75 ($50 for registered SoftwareFPU users) is a better native
PPC-code emulator and is 5-10 times quicker than SoftwareFPU. We use SoftwareFPU
and it works fine, but a 68881 program running on the PowerPC with native-version
SoftwareFPU is slower than a recompiled 68k program (sans 68881) running on the
same PowerPC.
