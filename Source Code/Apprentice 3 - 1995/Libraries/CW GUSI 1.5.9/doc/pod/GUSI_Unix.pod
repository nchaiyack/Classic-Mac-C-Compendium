=head2 Unix domain sockets

This domain is quite regular and supports all calls that
work on any domain, except for out-of-band data. 

=head2 Differences to generic behavior

Addresses are file system pathnames. C<GUSI> complies to the
Unix implementation in that it doesn't require the name to be terminated by a zero.
Names that are generated by C<GUSI>, however, will always be zero terminated (but
the zero won't be included in the count).

    struct sockaddr_un {
      short    sun_family;    /* Always AF_UNIX     */
      char     sun_path[108]; /* A pathname to a file */
    };
    
C<choose()> works both for existing and new addresses, and no restriction
is possible (or necessary).
