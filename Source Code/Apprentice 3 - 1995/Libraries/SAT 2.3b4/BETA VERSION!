NOTE: BETA VERSION. DO NOT CONFUSE THIS VERSION WITH THE FORTHCOMING RELEASE 2.3!Development releases:2.3d1: First full CodeWarrior version (with blitters).2.3d2: All demos CodeWarrior compatible. Manual updated. Fixed a bug that made SATPlotFace work incorrectly.2.3d3: SATRun2 introduced: a preliminary SATRun version that avoids drawing sprites that don't move nor change their face. (Someone called that "staggered drawing".) This is of interest to you if you have a significant number of sprites or large sprites that spend much of their time sitting still. SATRun2 might not work with SATSkip. If all your sprites move or change face every frame, then it's not for you. SATRun2(true) (i.e. fast) does not work correctly with the current blitters for 1-bit and 4-bit graphics. Check out the demo "Bricks".	Also fixed a bug in the non-ColorQD blitter. Note: The "SAT blitters.rsrc" file holds the current blitters. I MIGHT, now or in the future, leave an old blitter in a demo by mistake. If you have problems, make sure you have the current ones.PPC 2.3d1: First PowerMac version, CodeWarrior only.2.3a1: A bit of optimizing, speeding up animations by… well, it depends on your application, but I timed a 20% speedup. Improved PICT resource handling. Fixed a bug in Preferences.p (in HeartQuest).2.3a2: Introduced SATPorts, eliminating the hassle with GDevices. Menu bar hiding improved - SATHideMBar will now update the menu bar area, and a minor bug in SATShowMBar was fixed. The blitter format is changed, so you must use the new ones.2.3b: Full PPC support, most demos have PPC project files. UPI interfaces are used Think Pascal users can use the file InterfacesUI.p to get the most important UPI declarations. The first PPC blitter (rect blitter only).2.3b2: PPC mask blitter (thanks to Bo Lindbergh). Bug fixes in depth switching and non-color QD blitters.2.3b3: Bug fix in the 68k 8-bit mask blitter. Multi-screen code now works!
