Collision /// demo=================Collision /// is "almost a game", and completely different from all other demos. It demonstrates a lot of variations that I think should be in some demo.¥ Sprite faces from code, e.g. text in sprite faces¥ Scaling a sprite face on-line¥ Collision detection from regions. (See the function RegionHitTest)¥ A pattern for background instead of PICTs¥ Desk accessory style: No borders, moveable window, animation driven fromordinary event loop. (This makes it unnecessarily slow, though!)¥ Single unit program: if you don't want to structure your programs like I do, youdon't have to.¥ On-line generated sounds (not too good so far, but takes no disk space)¥ Disposing and re-initializing SAT for a different setup. In this case I simply change the size of the animation area.The game is really silly, and the animation is jerky due to the use of a normal event loop.
