WETabsCode to add tab support to WASTE 1.1Dan Crevier (dan@rhino.harvard.edu)Original code by Mark AlldrittVersion 1.2May 8, 1995Introduction     WETabs is a set of routines to add support for tabs in WASTE 1.1 (version a7 or later).  It works with both the pascal version and the C port.History	WETabs 1.1 added the WETabs32.c file.	Starting with WASTE 1.1a7, the callback functions use UPP's.  This required a minor change in WETabs.  WETabs 1.1 works with WASTE 1.1a6 only, and WETabs 1.2 works with WASTE 1.1a7 or greater. Using WETabs     There are two versions of WETabs.  WETabs.c using the tab size as defined by WASTE_TAB_SIZE in WETabs.h.  WETabs32.c fixes the tab size at 32 pixels and optimizes some of the routines (as suggested by Mark Valence).     Using WETabs is simple.  Just include WETabs.c or WETabs32.c in your project, and then after creating a WASTE instance, call WEInstallTabHooks() to install the tab handling routines.  The prototype for the routine is in WETabs.h.Limitations¥ The tab size for WETabs.c is defined in WETabs.h and cannot be changed at runtime.¥ It may have problems dealing with horizontally scrolled views.If you have any questions, or find any bugs, I can be contacted at:mailto:dan@rhino.harvard.edu
