sockets

unixincludes - unix header files necessary to compile or use sockets

unixlib - C library or Unix system calls not provided in the MPW libraries
          most are just dummies.

resolver - the Berkeley Bind name server code ported to work with this
           socket library

rpc - an old version of the sun rpc library. at least some of which has
      been ported to work with this socket library. According to the
      Copyright headers, it seems to be OK to redistribute this stuff with
      this package.
