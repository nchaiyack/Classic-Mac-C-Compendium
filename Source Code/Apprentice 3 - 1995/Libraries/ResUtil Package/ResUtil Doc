ResUtil Package 1.0emk@dartmouth.eduTHINK C for the MacintoshThis contains three routines for manipulating resources safely. Using these functions, you can delete resources completely (even if duplicated), install resources into files and copy resources between files. I wrote these for my upcoming Type Fixer utility (a drag & drop automatic file retyper with LF/CR conversion) and I have decided to distribute them as freeware. You may include these in any variety of software package, but you may not receive money for the source itself. If you find these useful, please contact me at the above address; I'd love to hear from you.No gaurantees are made as to the reliability, functionality or safety of this package. Back up your files and use at your own risk, etc...If you want version 1.0 of Type Fixer when it is released, please get in touch. I'll add you to the mailing list.
