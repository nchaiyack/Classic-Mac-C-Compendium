xgraph/mgraph ANSI C library for 2D and 3D wireframe graphicsMarch 22, 1994gonzalez@crab.rutgers.edu (Ralph Gonzalez)---------------------------------------------------------------The xgraph/mgraph library lets you supplement a stdio ANSI Capplication with a graphics window, without having to learna complex graphics package (like X Window or the MacintoshToolbox). You can choose the coordinate system used for drawing,and optionally alter the window size and location in a device-independent manner. You can also do wireframe perspectiveprojection of 3D objects. Limited user interaction is allowed,for writing simple games. Free.The files are:cube3d.cc, pendulum.cc, sample.cc - sample applications.xgraph.cc, xgraph.h - X Window 2D graphics routinesmgraph.c, mgraph.h - compatible Mac versionstrans.cc, trans.h - 3D tools (see cube3d example)boolean.h - boolean data typemakefile - for building executable xgraph.notes - this file. Please include with distributionTo see a sample application, type 'make', and then type'graph' when it's done compiling. See the comments at thetop of the makefile for instructions on modifying it foruse with your own source code.Note that the makefile uses g++, the gnu C++ compiler. Thisrequires the ".cc" extension, while you have to change tothe ".c" extension for the Mac. For some reason I couldn'tget the makefile to work if I specified gcc instead, eventhough all the files are ANSI C (not C++).
