This directory maintains the wordlist for crab.  The program compdictcompiles the dictionary file dict into dict.o, which is linked into../crab.  You can delete the wordlist dict (and dict.o too) to savespace once you have built crab, because it can be regenerated by"../crab -l > dict".  You can also add or delete words from thedictionary if you like (or even use an entirely different one) aslong as you heed the proviso at the beginning of compdict for theformat of the file dict.  If you like the wordlist the way it is, younever have to grovel around down here at all.Since the program compdict builds an executable file, it isn't entirelyportable as written.  I know it works with suns and vaxes, though.
