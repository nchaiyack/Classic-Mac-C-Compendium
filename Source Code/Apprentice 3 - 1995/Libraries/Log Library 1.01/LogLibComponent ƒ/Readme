Test Application Project Setup:

	For those of you not using SymC++ 7.0, this is how the project is set up:
	
	Segment 1:
		Libsprintf.c
		main.c
	
	Segment 2:
		MacTraps
		MacTraps2
		Test Application.rsrc /* the resource file */
	
	To build a single standalone app, set the project as follows:
	
	First, #define DEBUGIT in the project prefix in the prefs
	
	Second, the segments stay the same as above except the
	"LogLibComponent.c" file is added to segment 2.
	
LogLibComponent Project Setup:

	In one segment should be:
		LogLibComponent.c
		LogLibComponent.rsrc
		MacTraps
		MacTraps2
		New ShowInit.c
	
	The project settings should be:
		¥  Set for a code resource
		¥  File type/creator 'thng'/'LogC'
		¥  Name "LogLib Component"
		¥  Type 'CODE'
		¥  ID 300
		¥  Flags '00'
	
	And the #define DEBUGIT should ¥NOT¥ be defined!
