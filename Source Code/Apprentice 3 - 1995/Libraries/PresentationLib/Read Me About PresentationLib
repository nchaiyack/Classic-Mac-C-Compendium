Inside You've Got Something To Write

PresentationLib is a library (shared on PowerMac, Metrowerks 68k on 
SlowerMac) which handles two functions commonly needed by graphics 
utilities and games: Switching the screen depth and controlling the 
visibility of the menu bar.  Apple decided to make this much harder than 
it needs to be, causing many application developers to write bad 
implementations of the same code over and over again. Hence:
PresentationLib.

Unmodified versions of PresentationLib may be distributed freely.
You can use PresentationLib in any way you like otherwise.

However, the PresentationLib package (including the headers, 
PresentationLib libraries, and this ReadMe document) may not be modified 
for distribution to online services, and you may not distribute the 
package to Prodigy, Senator Exon (D-Nebraska) or to BBS' which charge a 
per-download fee.

PresentationLib is a very small subset of a larger GameShell library under 
development.

To use these functions, add the .c source files to your project file,
#include "gs MenuBar.h," or "gs DepthUtils.h" in your own source files.
The functions in "gs MenuBar.h" speak for themselves:

void HideMenuBar (void);
Hide the menubar.  Can be called repeatedly.

void ShowMenuBar (void);
Show the menubar.  Can be called repeatedly.

You are responsible for repainting the area occupied by the menu bar 
once hidden.

"gs DepthUtils.h" is mostly also self-explanatory:

enum depth
{
	k2Colors = 1,
	k16Colors = 4,
	k256Colors = 8,
	kThousandsColors = 24,
	kMillionsColors = 32
};

Boolean GSSwitchDepth(depth inDepth);
inDepth: the desired screen depth.

Switches the main screen to the required screen depth.
Returns false if the screen depth isn't available.  You must 
previously have checked to be sure ColorQD is available.

void GSRestoreDepth();
Restores the main screen to it's former depth.  Always call 
GSSwitchDepth first!
