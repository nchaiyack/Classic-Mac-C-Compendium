The Mercutio MDEF is a Menu DEFinition resource that allow developers to easily
and elegantly extend the power of their application menus. These MDEFs allow
menus to have multiple-modifier key-equivalents (e.g. shift-command-C),
custom icons, item callbacks, and other goodies.

Fixes since last beta release (1.2b20):

Major feature additions and changes since 1.1.5 are:

  - Support for non-printing keys (function keys, page up/down,
    arrow keys, etc)
  - Support for icon suites
  - Support for all 4 modifier keys (command, shift, option, control)
  - Removed command-key requirement (can have control-A as an equivalent)
  - User-definable style mapping: developer determines which style
    bits are used as feature flags
  - Dynamic items: items whose contents change depending on what 
    modifier keys are being held down (e.g. when the option key is
    held down, Save becomes Save All).
  - Application callback routine to let you decide on the fly what
    the item contents should be.

Minor changes since 1.1.5 include:

  - MDEF recognized by new resource ID (19999) so you can delete the resource
    name before shipping.
  - Fixed "Option" character icon.
  - Color icons drawn unhilited, even when the menu item is hilited.
  - Full support for Xmnu resource; includes TMPL resources for ResEdit
    and Resorcerer.
  - Xmnu with resource ID 0 lets you set default settings for all
    Mercutio menus.
  - Dvorak keyboard support
  - Fixed various small bugs.
  
As before, Mercutio includes:

  - System 7's Balloon Help and True Gray.
  - Color menus.
  - Small and large icons.
  - SICNs in hierarchical menu items.
  - 99% compatible with standard MDEF.
    
The Mercutio MDEF works under System 6.0.4 or later, with or without
Color QuickDraw. Mercutio is fully compatible with System 7, and supports
all the features of the System MDEF. Integrating the MDEF into your program
shouldn't take more than 15 minutes.
