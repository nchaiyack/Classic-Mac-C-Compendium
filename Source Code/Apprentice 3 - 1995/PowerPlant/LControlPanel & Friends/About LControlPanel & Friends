Version 1.0d1

This is a preliminary release of LControlPanel & Friends, a very small 
set of classes which enables the use of PowerPlant LPane subclasses 
(including, of course, LViews) in System 7 Control Panels.  Your LPanes 
require no modification to work with LControlPanel & Friends.  (Yeeha!)

There are two advantages to this approach:

1.  Copland will require control panels to be applications of a special 
type.  The same LPanes you use in your LControlPanel will work just fine 
in your LControlPanelApplication at some later point (sooner than you 
think! yeeha!  On Schedule!).

2.  Control Panels are incredibly annoying to write under normal 
circumstances.  PowerPlant soothes the pain and increases the power.

—————————————• The Shaky Hands

Hey! I've done literally five minutes of testing with this.  This 
software is provided AS IS.  It just might fry your Mac's CPU ("cpu" for 
you 68k owners).  You use it at your own risk.  The author is not 
responsible for damage caused by the use of this software, directly or 
indirectly, ad infinitum, ad naseum.

* You may distribute and use this freely with the following exceptions:

* You may not distribute this software through Prodigy.
* You may not distribute this software through Microsoft Network.
* The dishonorable Senators Exon and Dole may not use this software.
* Not that they would know a keyboard from a fig or have anywhere near 
the intellect of a thimble, let alone enough to program a computer, but 
it's the *principle*.

* This read me file must be included wherever the source files are 
distributed.  You may not distribute modified versions of these files.

—————————————• Usage Notes

Everything should be self-explanatory, if you're already experienced 
with PowerPlant; the possibly non-obvious things I've noted below.

• Project file

You need to have LGrafPortView in your project, and whatever pane stuff 
PP wants.  Add some of the basic utilties.  I'll put in an example next 
release.  I just don't have anything ready yet.

• Resources
Create a single 'nrct'-area covering your entire control panel.  
Multiple 'nrct' entries will complicate things needlessly and just 
duplicates what you already have in PowerPlant.  See IM: More Mac 
Toolbox for more information.

You need to have one *enabled* user item covering the entire control 
panel in the 'ditl' resource.

• Source

In order to instantiate your control panel subclass, which LControlPanel 
can't know about, you need to declare this function, which returns a 
pointer to your LControlPanel subclass.

StdControlPanel *CreateControlPanel(DialogPtr inDialog)
{
	return new MyControlPanelClassType; /* or whatever;  error checking can go here */
}

[LControlPanel is a subclass of StdControlPanel, which is a 
non-PowerPlant specific control panel class.  I might remove 
StdControlPanel in the future and go directly to PowerPlant.]
