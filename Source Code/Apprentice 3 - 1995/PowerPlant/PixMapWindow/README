PixMapWindow

	This class is most useful to me in debugging.  Pass it an offscreen LGWorld, and it will
bring up a window containing the graphic.  I haven't added support for a Scroller... if someone
else is interested in that, I'll incorporate it and give them credit.  I think everything in
it is pretty self explanatory.  If not, my email address is below.

example usage:

void
Booga::Wooga(Rect Ooga)
{
	LGWorld	Fooga;
	Rect	Mooga;
	
	SetRect(Mooga, 0, 5, 17, 23);
	Fooga = new LGWorld(Mooga, 0);
	Fooga->BeginDrawing();
	PaintRect(Ooga);
	Fooga->EndDrawing();
	new PixMapWindow(Fooga, false);
}

	Please feel free to use the code contained in this package in whatever manner you please,
free of charge.
