ABOUT CLISTBOX
==============
CListBox provides a framework for using an LDEF from within
your PowerPlant application. A fat LDEF code resource is included
that calls back the LDEF in the application through the list
handle's refCon field (thanks, Scott Knaster). The LDEF in the
application will dispatch messages to the proper object, so all
you have to do is provide a draw method and a hilite method in a
derived class (CListBox is an abstract class). Everything else
is taken care of.

COMPILING THE DEMO
==================
The demo projects are set up to produce a fat binary. To make
a fat binary: (1) compile the 68k project to produce the rsrc
file for the PPC project, and (2) compile the PPC project to
produce the fat app. To make a 68k app: (1) change the compiler
preferences to make an app instead of a resource file, and
(2) make it. To make a PPC app: (1) make a copy of the 68k
resource file and rename it to the same name as the PPC project
plus '.rsrc', and (2) make it.

COMPILING THE FAT LDEF STUB
===========================
(1) Compile the PPC project first.
(2) Copy the the data fork of the file created into a new
	resource of type pCod with id 128.
(3) Compile the 68k project. The resource file should now contain
	a pCod with id 128 and an oCod with id 128.
(4) Open the file LDEF.r and follow the instructions for filling
	in the value of the first two hexadecimal fields in the template.
(5) Rez the file LDEF.r to produce the fat code resource.
