Sample C++ Source CodeDavid KreindlerThis document is a general guide to the sample source code.Please note that the source code included with this document is confidential and is copyrighted by its author, David Kreindler, with all rights reserved.Packing ListThis package contains the following files.        About this Demo (this document)        AnimatedCursor.cp        AnimatedCursor.h        AnimatedCursor.i        AnimatedCursor_Utils.cp        AsyncPeriodical.cp        AsyncPeriodical.h        AsyncPeriodical.i        Header.h        Test        Test.cp        Test.r        Test68K        Test68K.prj        Test68K.prj.rsrc        TestPPC.prj        TestPPC.prj.rsrcAbout the ProjectThe built application, "Test," is a fat binary. It is built by means of two Metrowerks C++ projects: "Test68K.prj," which creates the 68000 code, and "TestPPC.prj," which creates the PowerPC code. The former builds the 68000 application, "Test68K," The latter builds the fat binary application, "Test," incorporating the file "TestPPC.prj.rsrc," which is an alias to "Test68K." (In other words, Test68K is used as the resource file for the project TestPPC.prj.)If you have the Metrowerks C++ compilers (68K and PPC) and universal Macintosh header files, you can modify and rebuild the .prj files. Otherwise, you can just peruse the source code, using whatever text editor you like. Please remember, though, that the source code is confidential and is copyrighted with all rights reserved.What the Sample Application DoesDepending upon what you are looking for, you might want to run the built application, "Test," before you start reading the source code This application demonstrates various flavors of cursor (pointer) animation.-        When first launched, the application animates the cursor synchronously.-        When the user clicks the mouse button, the application animates the cursor backwards, asynchronously, for as long as the mouse button is held down.-        When the user releases the mouse button, the application animates the cursor "automatically," which, in this case, amounts to a two-second delay before animation.Navigating the Source CodeThe main function is contained in the file "Test.cp." The files "AsyncPeriodical.h" and "AnimatedCursor.h" contain the declarations of the classes used for the cursor animation. Their definitions are contained in the corresponding .cp files, with the exception of inline member function definitions, which are in .i files.The derivation of the C++ classes that are used in the sample code is as follows.    class AsyncPeriodical;    class VBLPeriodical: public AsyncPeriodical;    class AnimatedCursor;    class AsyncAnimCursor: public AnimatedCursor, public VBLPeriodical;    class AutoAnimCursor: public AsyncAnimCursor;The classes AsyncAnimCursor and AutoAnimCursor are instantiated in Test.cp.RespondingIf you have any questions, suggestions or offers of work, please feel free to contact the author, David Kreindler, at one of the addresses below.snailmail        PO Box 524, Ithaca NY 14851, USAemail            dkreindl@well.comtelephone        (607) 257-9428
