Apple’s MIDI Manager is the future of MIDI programming on the Macintosh. 
The MIDI Manager allows applications to exchange MIDI messages with 
external devices as well as with other MIDI Manager compatible 
applications. Using PatchBay, MIDI musicians can connect multiple MIDI 
Manager applications under MultiFinder.

The CMIDI class library provides an interface to the MIDI Manager. A wide 
range of MIDI applications, from simple editors and librarians to 
sophisticated real-time musical tools, lend themselves to object oriented 
design.

Built on the OOP extensions in Symantec Corporation's Symantec C++ 6.0 
compiler, CMIDI defines a set of classes integrated into the THINK Class 
Library (TCL). CMIDI classes define MIDI Manager objects including input, 
output, and time ports.
