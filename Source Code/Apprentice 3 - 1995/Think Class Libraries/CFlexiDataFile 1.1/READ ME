A subclass of CDataFile which lets you pretend that a resource,
a handle, or even just a section of RAM is a data fork.  This is
mostly useful because of the abstraction--other classes don't have
to know where the data is coming from.
 
The partial resource calls (except size-changes) work under
system 6, because the code makes use of JPartialResources
(not included).  You can, for example, read or write the middle
ten bytes of a ten-meg resource, without loading any of it
into RAM (except those ten bytes).
