						ATTENTION  ALL  PROGRAMMERS:Building on Chris Wysocki's pioneering work with his "CPEditText", I amintroducing my "CPStyleText" source which represents my initial attemptsto effect a direct replacement for the standard TCL CStyleText classwithout TextEdit's limitation to a maximum 32k of text.Please read VERY carefully the enclosed " Enhanced StyleEdit Note" file orthe beginning of my "CPStyleText.c" file for the details of all my changesSO FAR.I am soliciting a group programming effort whereby WE can expand Chris'inaugural efforts to a truly marvelous TCL Text Engine.  I would appreciateVERY much if you programmers would upload to me any and all suggestionsfor improvement, no matter how minute or how large.I had initially uploaded these same files to Chris.  He answered thatregretfully his everyday plate was very full and did NOT currently havetime to devote to my proposed extensions to his "CPTextEdit".  He wishedus luck.I really believe that if enough of US act in concert, we can make greatand timely strides in developing a great TCL Text Engine.By the way, just for the record ... I will NOT pay you.  If we succeed,and subsequently sell the product then, of course, we all share inproportion to our respective inputs.Sincerely,						John A.
