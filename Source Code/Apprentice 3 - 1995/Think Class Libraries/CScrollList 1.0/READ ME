CScrollList is a class I wrote
to replace CTable for scrolling lists.  I was sick of using Cells
when I only needed one column (which was every time I used it),
and I didn't need multiple selections.  This simplified it greatly.
I included it only as an example.  I'm still adding new things to
it, but I could use _any_ input whatsoever.  The documentation is
weak at best, but it's pretty self-explanatory (except for the
kSLEditable option -- good luck figuring that one out :)  Try it
out, and P L E A S E send me some feedback.  Thanks!
