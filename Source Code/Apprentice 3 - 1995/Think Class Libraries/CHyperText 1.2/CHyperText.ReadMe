CHyperText 1.2  By Martin R. WachterCHyperText is a subclass of CStyleText which provides TCL with support forHyperText similar to the hypertext features in THINK Reference and Mosaic.CHyperText can stylize certain "hyperwords" on the fly, which are containedin a CStringArray.  These words become stylized in bold + underline to distinguishthem from the rest of the text as hyperwords.  You may want to pre-stylize yourhyperwords in ResEdit or Resorcerer© to speed up your final app. Remember to NOTset the itsHyperList member if you do this, or your TEXT will be stylized twice.Clicking on a hyperword, causes the hyper word to flash, thus signaling to the user that they have successfully click a hyperword.  The CHyperText's clickCmd is then sent to itsSupervisor.  You can find out what the hyperwordwas by checking the lastHyperword data member.  AdjustCursor() is alsosupported to provide more visual feedback when the cursor is over a hyperword.CHyperText also comes with a TMPL in Resorcerer format, to edit and create HyTxpanes in your dialogs, and load them by AddOverloadItem() through the IViewTemp()methods.See the enclosed demo program and source for an example on how to use this class.NOTE:  To compile and run this demo you must place the folder "CHyperText Folder"in the Symantec C++ for Macintosh Tree along with CStringArray.cp and CStringArray.h(which came with the NewClassDemo in your Symantec C++ package), or you will get errors that the file can't be found.This project is also an excellent example of how to create a dialog based TCLshell application.Enjoy!Marty Wachercomments/complaintsmrw@welchgate.welch.jhu.eduafamarty@aol.com
