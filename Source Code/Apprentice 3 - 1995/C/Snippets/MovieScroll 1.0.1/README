Another public domain demo of "movie" type scrolling, courtesy of
Kenneth A. Long 

An itty bitty bytesª production, for the benefit of anyone who can
use it.

This is basically just "Bullseye" with some things dumped and two
routines added, and a resource file to back the additions. 

If you want the text drawn over black, like in the movies, then
some other "girations" are necessary. This just shows the
scrolling, with style.  

Enjoy!
