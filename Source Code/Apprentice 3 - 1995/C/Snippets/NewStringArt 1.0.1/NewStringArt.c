// NewStringArt 1.0.1// adapted from a Sun Microsystems demo by Ron Hitchens// ported to CodeWarrior by Ken Long (kenlong@netcom.com)// updated for CodeWarrior 6 on 950712/*	This program is public domain.  It may be be freely distributed, *	copied and used.  All I ask is that my name and this notice remain *	on it.  And that modifications be noted in this source listing and *	returned to me if possible at the above email address. * *	History: *		May 85	Hitchens	Created. *		May 28	Hitchens	Look at screen size vars, add comments * * *	Compilation instructions with Megamax C: *	You need the C source files stringart.c and gennums.c *		1. compile and link gennums.c *		2. run gennums, it creates a C source file named stringnums.c *		  This name is hard-coded in gennums.c *		3. Compile stringnums.c, but don't link it.  Keep stringnums.o *		4. Compile stringart.c *		5. Link stringart.o and stringnums.o together to make stringart *		6. Run StringArt. *		7. Sit back and enjoy the show. *	If you make changes to stringart, after doing the above, you can skip *	to 4.  Stringnums doesn't need to be re-compiled. *	If you want to port this to another flavor of C you're on your own. * *	The icon was created manually with the resource editor, to retain *	the icon when recompiling just specify the name of the old  *	StringArt application file as the output of the linker.  It will *	overwrite the code but won't disturb the icon resources. *//*	This demo creates random vector designs.  This is accomplished by	randomly choosing a function for each coordinate halve of the two	points describing a vector that moves through two dimensional	space. Both x coordinate halves cannot be the same since the design	would simply be a collection of vertical lines. Similarly both	y coordinate halves cannot be the same.	The functions are:	function[0][x] = sin( 2 * PI * x / numLines )	function[1][x] = -sin( 2 * PI * x / numLines )	function[2][x] = cos( 2 * PI * x / numLines ) 	function[3][x] = -cos( 2 * PI * x / numLines ) 	function[4][x] = sin( 4 * PI * x / numLines )	function[5][x] = -sin( 4 * PI * x / numLines )	function[6][x] = cos( 4 * PI * x / numLines ) 	function[7][x] = -cos( 4 * PI * x / numLines ) 	function[8][x] = sin( 6 * PI * x / numLines )	function[9][x] = -sin( 6 * PI * x / numLines )	function[10][x] = cos( 6 * PI * x / numLines ) 	function[11][x] = -cos( 6 * PI * x / numLines ) 	function[12][x] = 2 * abs( x - (numLines / 2) - 1 )	*not used*	The values of the functions were pre-computed to have the demo	run as fast as possible.  The program runs in an endless loop, it 	will terminate if the "Quit" menu item is selected or a 'Q' is typed.*/#define numLines	343	/* number of vectors in a design */#define num_functions	12	/* number of functions */#define Voffset		19	/* offset from top, drag is under menu bar */#define border		2	/* surrounding blank border */				/* get real size of screen, in case of Lisa or something new */#define Hsize (qd.screenBits.bounds.right)#define Vsize (qd.screenBits.bounds.bottom)WindowRecord	myRecord;	/* if you can't figure out what these are */WindowPtr	myWindow;	/* you'd better give up right now */MenuHandle	myMenu;short holding = 0;		/* are we currently holding? */short step = 0;			/* single step? */short q [4][numLines];		/* temp array for scaled coordinates */extern short p [num_functions][numLines];	/* pre-computed points, scaled by 1024 */long ticks;main(){	short i, j, k, l, m;	long secs;		Init ();		/* do housekeeping */	ShowInfo ();		/* display bragging info */	GetDateTime ((unsigned long*) qd.randSeed);	/* randomize the Random() function */	while (1) {		/* main loop, go round and round forever */		/* pick the functions */		while ((i = Random() % num_functions) < 0) /* nothing */ ;		while ((j = Random() % num_functions) == i || (j < 0));		while ((k = Random() % num_functions) < 0);		while ((l = Random() % num_functions) == k || (l < 0));		/* scalepoints was a hack to speed up the line drawing, by		  avoiding the scaling computations for each coordinate		  while the lines are being drawn.
