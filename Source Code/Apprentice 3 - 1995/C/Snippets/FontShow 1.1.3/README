Note from Ken Long:

I found this source on the net, but it was only the .c and .h file.
Then after a time, I found the built application in a different place
and was able to get the resources out of it.  Then I made the .r file
from it, for general principles.

The two includes I excluded caused link errors I couldn't fix, but it
seems to run okay at first glance.  I've done hardly any testing, and
I'm sure there could be improvements, refinements and more thorough
code added.  But HEY!  It's C source!

Due to popular demand (hello Holgi!) FontShow v1.1.1 now contains 
a Fontsize
menu and indicates the font id in addition to the font name.
Also a minor bug fix.

The FontShow - a print utility (v1.1.1)

I was sometimes asked by collegues what font they should use for 
a document. Well, Key Caps shows you what characters are available 
but you need a longer text to get some impression of what a font 
really looks like. So I made this quick hack called FontShow.

The File menu allows you to direct the output either to the video 
screen or to the printer. After selecting either Print or Display 
you will first see a list of all fonts installed in your system 
(or under SuitCase) so that you can select any fonts you like to see. 

The Options menu only affects the screen output! You can select 
either a sample text, the well-known sentence "the quick brown 
fox..." in upper and lowercase, or a character table. When you 
direct your output to the printer you will always get all of this 
stuff printed out.

The Fontsize menu can be used to select the character size. 
FontShow will only display a font if the selected size is available 
for this font; it will not scale fonts to that size.

You may change the sample text or string by using ResEdit to edit 
the resource fork of FontShow. The sample text is contained in a 
TEXT resource with ID 128. Take care that each line is terminated 
by a 0x0D character! The program does no text length checking so 
make sure that your sample text fits on the page. The sample strings 
are in a STR# resource with ID 129. You may change or add strings 
but, again, no length checking is performed.

This program is distributed under the HAPPYWARE system:
If you like it, remember to SMILE!
