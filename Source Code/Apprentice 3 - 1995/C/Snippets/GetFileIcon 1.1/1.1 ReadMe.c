/*GetFileIcon.c3/15/95ver 1.1First, I'd like to say that I tried to make GetFileIcon (GFI) accessable to as manydevelopers and development environment platforms possible.  If you are still usingthe old universal headers, use the THINK C or CodwWarrior project in the "Old Headers"folder.  If you use the new universal headers (for PPC & 68k development), check outthe files in the "Universal Headers" folder.Second, I'd like to say that none of this would have been possible without the aid ofErik A. Johnson (johnsone@uxh.cso.uiuc.edu).  Erik provided fixes to the code so it couldbe compiled in CodwWarrior, implemented the Universal Headers ProcPtr code, andinformed me of several bugs.Here are some notes that Erik sent me:Modified: 3/1/95 by eaj  -- removed the 680x0 assembly from FindGenericIconID() and                            put the data in the globals gGenericFinderIcons and                            gGenericSysIcons                         -- removed most of GetFileIcon.h because most of it reproduced                            the Universal Header files Icons.h and Finder.h (these are                            now included within the new GetFileIcon.h.                         -- added a call to PBHGetVolParms() in InOneDesktop() to make                            sure a volume supports the Desktop Manager before trying to                            examine the Desktop database in that volume                         -- modified the calls to ForEachIconDo() (in the routines                            GetNormalFileIcon(), CopyEachIcon(), Get1IconSuite(), and                            IsSuiteEmpty()) to use UniversalProcPtr's.Compiles fine with CW5 (MW C/C++ 1.2).  I haven't tried it with MPW PPCC or THINK C.To use GetFileIcon(), include GetFileIcon.c in your project, and in your source dosomething like:#include "GetFileIcon.h"FSSpec  myFileFSSpec;Handle  myIconSuite;OSErr   err;Rect    myRect={0,0,32,32};err = GetFileIcon( &myFileFSSpec, svAllAvailableData, &myIconSuite );PlotIconSuite( &myRect, atNone, ttNone, myIconSuite );*/
