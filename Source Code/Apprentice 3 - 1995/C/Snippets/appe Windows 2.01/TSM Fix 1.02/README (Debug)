The enclosed INIT fixes the jGNEFilter "Missing Clicks" bug. I have tried it with
several of my TSM floating windows implementations, an old version PopUpFuncs,
and SuperClock -- with no problems. It also works with FKEY's that call WNE and
other cases with multiple event loops in the same application.

Try it out for a couple of days with any software you commonly use
that implements a jGNEFilter?

The DEBUG version has a DebugStr compiled in so that you know when it is
about to fix a "Missed Click." You can verify by NOP-ing out the jGNEFilter
jump code and letting it run -- you will start missing those clicks again.

Thanks alot,

BTW, it does head and tail patches GNE to see if an event was filtered,
and if not it will jump thru the filters itself. It took me a few weeks
to figure out the oddities of globally patching a trap that doesnt always
return to the same application -- but I think it works well. :)
