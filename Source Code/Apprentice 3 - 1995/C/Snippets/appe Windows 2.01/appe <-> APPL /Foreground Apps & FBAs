Foreground AppsFaceless Background Apps (FBAs)FBA System ExtensionsWhat's the Difference?Appe Windows programs can run in 3 different ways. I have provideda drag-n-drop util to swap between the 2 popular forms. Let's describeeach by its settings, appearance, and functionality.Foreground Apps:Most Mac applications are run as foreground apps, using the menu barand putting up windows onto the screen. Applications are typicallyrepresented by diamond shaped icons, and launched by double clicking.The file type is 'APPL' and the 'SIZE' resource has the Background Onlyflag CLEARed. Appe Windows now supports a graphic interface and menubar management.FBA System Extensions:The other popular format for distribution is as a System Extension.Such programs are executed automatically at startup, and never appearunder the Applications menu. They have the puzzle piece icon, andbelong in the System Extensions folder. File type is 'appe' and theBackground only flag is SET in the 'SIZE' resource. Appe Windows hasalways worked as an FBA.Faceless Background Apps:An intermediate format is the simple FBA, that you can double click onfrom within the Finder. Files of type 'APPL' that have the BackgroundOnly bit *SET* inside the 'SIZE' resource. Such programs are double-clickable anytime, but never appear in the Applications menu or take over the menubar and interface. Appe Windows can work this way,but I prefer the other two for simplicity.I hope this clears the questions you have (short and sweet ;).Matt Slotfprefect@umich.edu
