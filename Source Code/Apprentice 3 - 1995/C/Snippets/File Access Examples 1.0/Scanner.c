/* Scanner.c * * This file contains two routines which, used together, will scan * through all files/folders on all mounted volumes on your Mac and * take some sort of action for each file/folder found. If you * only want to scan one volume, call ScanFolders with a volume * reference number and a directory ID of zero. * * If you wanted to search a volume for a small number of files * based on their characteristics, this is the WRONG way to do it. * Use PBCatSearch for that purpose. * * If, on the other hand, you need to find ALL of the files and/or * folders on a volume, or need to examine each (as in a virus * scanning program), these routines can handle that just fine. * Also, if you definitely want to scan files in alphabetical * order (as they appear in the finder), that's the way these * routines scan. * * All Macintosh files are indexed (have an index number) within * their directory/folder. If there are five files in a folder, * they will always have index numbers one through five. Folders * have indexes just as files do. If the third file in the folder * was a subfolder rather than a file, it would still have index * number three. The routines in this file work by starting at * the root folder of a volume and simply counting the index up * from one getting file information based on each index number. * Whenever a subfolder is found, the routine recurses and * counts through the files in that subfolder. * * NOTE that the routines here do NOT take into account the fact * that the indexes of files can change within a directory between * calls to PBGetCatInfo if another process adds or deletes a file * during that time. There are ways to get around that which * usually involve rescanning the same directory, but the way * you handle it depends on your purpose for scanning. For * example, it wouldn't matter a whole lot if you scanned a few * files twice with a virus scanner. * * By the way, you can tell if indexes have shifted within a * directory by calling PBGetCatInfo a second time with the same * index number just before moving to the next index number. * Compare the file name returned with the file name you got * last time you called PBGetCatInfo with that index to make * sure they're the same. If they are, then immediately call * PBGetCatInfo for the next index number. If they're not, * that's when you need to rescan or whatever. */ #include "Scanner.h"#include "ActionRoutines.h"		/* This file contains the routines   */								/* FolderAction and FileAction       */								/* which are simply example routines */								/* that write to a file opened in    */								/* the main routine. *//* ScanVolumes loops and finds all mounted volumes (up to 256) and * calls ScanFolders to scan all files and folders on each volume * found. */void	ScanVolumes( void ){	HParamBlockRec	pb;		/* an HFS parameter block */	short	x;	Str31	volumeName;		pb.volumeParam.ioCompletion = NULL;		/* no completion routine */	pb.volumeParam.ioNamePtr = volumeName;	/* assign storage for name */	pb.volumeParam.ioVRefNum = 0;		for ( x=1; x<=256; x++ )		/* loop through volume indexes */	{		pb.volumeParam.ioVolIndex = x;		PBHGetVInfo( &pb, false );		if ( pb.volumeParam.ioResult != noErr )		{			/* Error means no more mounted volumes */						break;	/* break out of the for loop */		}		else		{			/* Found a valid volume.
