The code presented only works properly if the window is at the top left
of the screen. The reason for this is as follows:

  myCWindowMemPtr = (Byte *)(GetPixBaseAddr(myCWindowRecord.port.portPixMap));
  myCWindowRowOffSet = (0x7FFF & (**myCWindowRecord.port.portPixMap).rowBytes);

GetPixBaseAddr() doesn't work properly with PixMaps from anything other than
a GWorld. i.e. window PixMaps are not handled correctly.

Fairly extensive testing on a range of monitor sizes has led me to believe
that using GetPixBaseAddr() on a window actually returns the base address
of the PixMap of the SCREEN that the window is on. Therefore if your window
has it's top-left at (x,y), you should do:

myCWindowMemPtr += (x * myCWindowRowOffSet) + y;

As far as I can tell this works on all macs. However, you may run into problems
with multiple monitors. In this case it is probably better to get the
baseAddr of the PixMap of the graphic device itself. You can then offset it as
just described.

You should still put a window on the screen to cover the area which you will
be drawing to, so that you don't interfere with windows belonging to other
applications.
