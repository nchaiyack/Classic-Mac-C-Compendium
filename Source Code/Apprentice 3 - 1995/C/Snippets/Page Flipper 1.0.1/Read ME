Page Flipper 1.0.1

This little application demonstrates code to handle a page flipping effect, as seen in many other applications. 

I started writing it for a project and thought it would be helpful to others, so I put this together.  The demo can flip pages from the right or left, forwards and backwards.  The source code provided is easily adaptable to different size pages, all it requires is the appropriate resources to draw information from.  You may wish to use code instead of User Items and Pict resources, I chose to do it this way.

If you're new to QuickDraw, this code will give you some helpful insight into basic QuickDraw operations; defining and using regions, shape drawing, using the pen.  It should be easy to read code, even for beginners.

This code may be used freely.  I wouldn't mind credit, if you use it, and a copy of the program.  The Page Flipper archive (source code, resources, demo app, and Read ME) may be distributed freely, so long as it is not modified.

Corrections from 1.0:
     I was a little sloppy and left in a 'CNTL' resource that didn't belong to this project.  I also had "#include	 <GestaltEqu.h>" in the code, and had declared DoUpdate() as a Boolean; both were unneccessary in the code.  None of this hurt the performance, but may have confused a few people!  Sorry!
