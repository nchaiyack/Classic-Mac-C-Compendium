This demo is free.Steve Chamberlain (author of TetrisMax 2.1) sent me this in responseto a question I asked about getting cicns to move.Try commenting out the 	"FillCRect(&bRect, myPat);" line, in theDrawFrame() function, and run the project.-Ken-kenlong@aol.comkenlong@netcom.com-------------------------------------------------------------------Date:  93-11-07 13:32:45 ESTFrom:  KenLongSubj:  Little animation demo.To:    GranolaSteve:Howdy!Do you recall that little animation demo you sent me?  The one with the wood-grain ppat and random cicn's floating around over it?I was wondering if it would be okay if I post it for other people to learn from what it demonstrates?  I've seen several questions in programming forums that little demo would answer.Thanks.-Ken---------------------------------------------------------------------Date:  93-11-11 20:03:51 ESTFrom:  GranolaSubj:  Re: Little animation demo.To:      KenLongSure, feel free to post it. It's not the greatest code, but if it can help some people out... why not?   Thanks for asking.Steve------------------------------------------------------------------
