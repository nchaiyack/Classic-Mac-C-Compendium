SAVRGestaltThomas Reedreed@medicine.wustl.edu(Note:  This code was written in CodeWarrior using the Universal Headers.)Okay, here it is...  Some source code on how to install a SAVR Gestalt, as should be used in ALL screen savers.  You could use the same method to install a SAVC Gestalt if you like.First, you need the SAVRGestalt.c code in a file in a single project all by itself.  This project should be set up to produce a code resource of type GDEF that gets loaded into the system heap and is locked.After the SAVRGestalt.c code, I've got an explanation of what you need to do in your app to install and remove the SAVR Gestalt selector.I'll try to use comments throughout to explain what's going on.  I hope that this helps folks to start supporting the SAVR Gestalt in their screen savers a little bit better.If anyone has any questions or comments, feel free to e-mail me.
