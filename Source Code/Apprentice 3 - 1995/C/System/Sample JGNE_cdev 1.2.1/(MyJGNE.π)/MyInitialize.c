For the most part, this same information is also held in memory//	(in the shared data structure) while the computer is running so that the//	task code and cdev can access the settings.  The resource is normally accessed//	once here, then accessed and possibly changed later by the//	control panel code.////	This preferences resource contains values that indicate whether or not the//	task should be installed (control panel on or off) and whether or not the//	icon should be shown at startup time.//Boolean MyInitialize( myDataPtr myData, Boolean *installTask, Boolean *showIcon ){	Boolean				stillOK = true;	/* return value */	CPprefsHandle		prefsHandle;	/* Handle to the cdev prefs rsrc */	// Initialize the preferences resource handle in myData to NULL			myData->CPprefsRsrc = NULL;				//	Load the control panel's preferences resource to see if we should show	//	the icon at startup and the task should be 'on.'
