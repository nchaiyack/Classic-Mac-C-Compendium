Mousebroken is a control panel which will give you greater control over your mouse (or less control, depending on how you look at it).  To install, first drag the Mousebroken control panel onto your system folder.  (Under System 7, allow it to be moved to the “Control Panels” folder.)  Second, drag the “Mouse Modules” folder onto your system folder.  That’s it!  Mousebroken is ready to use; you don’t even need to restart.

When you open up the Mousebroken control panel, you can choose which mouse module you would like to install by clicking on the arrows.  The available mouse modules are the ones in the “Mouse Modules” folder in your system folder.  To install the mouse module, simply close the Mousebroken control panel.  The mouse module will stay active as long as Mousebroken is closed.  (The mouse module will be installed automatically when you restart, too.)  If none of the choices for mouse modules appeal to you, click “Off” and Mousebroken will leave your mouse alone forever (or until you click “On,” whichever is sooner).

Keep in mind that you don’t have to keep all the mouse modules.  If any of them bore you or annoy you, or both, simply throw those modules out.  As new modules are written, you can simply copy the ones you like into the “Mouse Modules” folder.


VERSION HISTORY:

NOTE TO PROGRAMMERS:
This mouse module system was designed to be as flexible as possible.  I encourage fellow programmers to take a whack at designing your own mouse modules.  It’s easy and it’s fun, and you get to muck about with undocumented low-memory globals.  All the mouse modules included in this archive are public domain, so you can look at my efforts as a starting point.  (Some of them are even commented!)  Source for Mousebroken itself is also available; see the separate file “GNU General Public License” for licensing terms.
