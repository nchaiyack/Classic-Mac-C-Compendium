CDIconKiller============© 1994, 1995 Quinn & Peter N Lewis, Fabrizio OddoneQuinn <quinn@cs.uwa.edu.au>Peter N Lewis <peter.lewis@info.curtin.edu.au>Fabrizio Oddone <gspnx@di.unito.it> <Ñ send bug reports here!To suppress custom icons on CD-ROMs, floppy disks and networked disks install this extension.This tends to speed up the Finder by a factor of about a zillion.To temporarily show the custom icons, hold down the Command () key when opening a folder.Caveats-------Works Òas isÓ with AppleÕs CD-ROM driver, floppies and networked disks.To let it work with non-AppleÕs CD-ROM drivers (or other drivers), modify the resource 'STR#' with ID=128 to include your driver name.Q.: HELP! WhatÕs my driver name? I couldnÕt find it on my passport!A. #1: open the control panel or extension containing the driver with ResEdit, open the 'DRVR' resource type, get info, copy the driver name into the 'STR#' 128 in CDIconKiller.A. #2: (for Power Users) drop into Macsbug, type 'drvr', select the right driver, go to ResEdit as before.Works under System 6 :-)Warning: This program was (originally) written in 4 hours.Version History---------------1.3.3: Fixes a small bug that could prevent the Command-key shortcut from working (thanks to Patrick Dyson for having pointed this out). Asm source is back! (I forgot, sorryÉ)1.3.2: now works with Apple PowerCDs. No code changes.1.3.1: was considering only the first string in the STR# resource: fixed.1.3: should be async-calls compatible; you may specify more than one driver (currently considers the first fifteen strings in the resource; enough?).1.2: now always loads the patch at startup: can load before your CD driver, works with LoadADrive by Dieter Spaar <spaar@mirider.abg.sub.org>.1.1.1: added the 'sysz' resource, the  key shortcut, fixed the misaligned icon at startup (suggested by Masatsugu Nagata), better TrapAvailable (written by Stefan Kurth).1.1: bug fixes, CD driver string in resource (suggested by Quinn), asm tweaks etc. by Fabrizio Oddone1.0: 05:30 18 June 1994 Original Release by Quinn & Peter N Lewis
