Debugger FKEY 1.0, ©1994 Reinder Verlinde

What is does:

This is an FKEY resource, which enables one to enter MacsBug by pressing command-shift-0 (the zero on the top row of the keyboard). To make installing the FKEY easier I have ‘encapsulated’ it into a font suitcase. That way you can simply put it on your Fonts folder to install it. The custom icon helps you to see that it isn’t really a FKEY.

How it works:

It checks for the presence of absence of MacsBug by looking at the low-memory global MacJmp. If it is 0x00000000 or 0x80000000 it calls SysBeep, in all other cases it calls the _Debugger trap. I am not sure whether this is the proper way to check for the presence of MacsBug, but it works on a IIx and a IIsi.

Distribution policy:

This FKEY may be freely distributed, as long as this accompanying documentation and the source code are also distributed.
