/* * Notifier.c * * Completed on 11/14/93 by Ken Worley using Symantec Think C 6.0.1. * * Contains the StrFormat and StrNotify routines.  Note that the ANSI, ANSI-small, * or ANSI-A4 library must be included in your project for these routines to work. * *//*	StrFormat * * This routine creates a string out of a format string containing type specifiers * and an undetermined number of other arguments just like the printf group of * library routines. * * The second argument is a format string just like the kind used with the library * routine printf and the following arguments are inserted in the string based on * the specifiers in the format string.  For more info on this, see the explanation * for the printf routine in the standard libraries.  Besides the extra string * argument and the fact that the result is put into a Pascal string, the routines * are very alike.  (In fact, the library routine vsprintf is used to format the * string which is then transferred to a Pascal string.)  Make sure you do NOT send * the address of the Str255 variable. */void	StrFormat( Str255 theString, const char* formatString, ... ){	va_list		arguments;	char		tempString[256];	short		x, theLength;		va_start( arguments, formatString );	vsprintf( tempString, formatString, arguments );	va_end( arguments );	theLength = strlen( tempString );	theString[0] = theLength;		if ( theLength )		for ( x=1; x<=theLength; x++ )			theString[x] = tempString[x-1];}/* * StrNotify * * This routine uses the Notification manager to send a message to the user.  The * memory for the NMRec and string are allocated by the calling program and pointers * to those items are sent to StrNotify. * * You must send a pointer to a struct of type NMRec (a notification record) and a * POINTER to a string of type Str255.  The memory pointed to by these two arguments * must be LOCKED (non-relocatable) and must continue to exist until after the * notification is made.  Since there is no mechanism here to determine when the * notification occurs, it would be best for the memory to be static or permanently * allocated. */void	StrNotify( NMRec *nm, Str255 *str ){		nm->nmMark = 0;	nm->nmIcon = NULL;	nm->nmSound = 0;	nm->nmStr = (StringPtr)str;	nm->nmResp = (NMUPP)-1L;	nm->nmRefCon = 0L;	nm->qType = nmType;		NMInstall( nm );}/* EXAMPLE *//* * This code: * * int		x; *	long	l; * static NMRec  myNMRec; * static Str255 myString; * * x = 5; * y = 250; * * StrFormat( myString, "The value %ld divided by 50 is %d.", y, x ); * StrNotify( &myNMRec, &myString ); * * Produces a Notification dialog box containing the following text: * *     The value 250 divided by 50 is 5. */
