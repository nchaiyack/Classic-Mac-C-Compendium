/*	MyPatch.c	Written by Ken Worley, 10/04/94, using Symantec Think C 7.0.	Copyright 1994. All Rights Reserved.		Feel free to use this code in a patch of your own.  Please don't	publish or distribute this code without giving me proper credit.		This code is set up to use Apple's "Universal Headers."  If you're not	using those, some slight modifications may be necessary (changing	pointer types).		This is the 'task' or 'patch' portion of the code.  The INIT or extension	portion of the code runs at system startup time, loads this piece of code into	memory, and installs it as a patch to a trap.		This code shares a data structure with the extension portion of the code,	the control panel code, and possibly with other code as well.  One of the fields	in this shared data is called CPon.  This field is initially set by the	extension based on the values in the 'pref' resource.  The control panel code	may modify it later based on the user's choices in the control panel.  The	field determines whether we take action here, or jump to the original trap	without making any modifications.		A pointer here is assigned to the address 0x12345678.  When the extension code	loads this code into memory, it replaces that bogus address with the address	of the shared data structure in memory.		Using routines in the ANSI-A4 library (like vsprintf) requires that we set up	the A4 register here for access to globals.  Curiously, when I failed to do	that, the end result worked fine on my Performa 405 and crashed my Classic.		BUILDING THE CODE RESOURCE			This file should be included in a project of type 'code resource' with		MacTraps and ANSI-A4.  The resource type should be whatever is specified		in the MyExtension.c file (by a #define) and the ID should also be		whatever is specified in the MyExtension.c file (by a #define). The		resource attributes should indicate that this resource goes in the system		heap and that it should NOT be locked.*//* PROTOTYPES */void	main( void );Boolean	StrCompare( Str255 str1, Str255 str2 );/* INCLUDED FILES */#include "Notifier.h"		/* prototypes and includes for StrFormat and StrNotify */#include "SharedData.h"		/* The definition of our shared data structure. */							/* Includes definitions of myDataStruct, myDataPtr, */							/* and myDataHandle to refer to this data. */#include <Traps.h>			/* includes trap names like _BlockMove */#include <SetUpA4.h>/* FUNCTIONS */void	main( void ){	myDataPtr		myData;			/* a pointer to our shared data */	long			oldTrapLoc;		/* local var to hold the old trap routine addr */	long			pBytes, rBytes;	/* vars for # of bytes in params & return val */	Boolean			callOriginal;	/* this determines whether we call orig trap */	Ptr				paramAddr;		/* set to the addr of the params on the stack */	Ptr				returnAddr;		/* set to the addr of the ret val on the stack */	Boolean			takeAction;		/* this flag determines whether this trap has */									/* any real effect */		/*	Set up the A4 register for access to statics and globals. */			RememberA0();		SetUpA4();			/*	Here's where we assign a bogus address to our data structure pointer.	 *	Again, this will be edited by the extension code so that it becomes a	 *	valid address (using the Munger routine).
