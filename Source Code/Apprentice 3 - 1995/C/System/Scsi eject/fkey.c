/*an FKEY which ejects a disk in a SCSI device, trying all possible methodsto do that (except, obviously, pushing a mechanical eject button)main written by Gabriele Speranza, 10 April 1993the rest was taken from suntar 2.0 beta 5 (June 93)bug fix for SyQuest 27 June 93changed the behaviour for virtual memory (both because I'd found a bug	in the old one, and because I wanted to release the full source	and I preferred to avoid including the full, powerful SCSI routine	used by suntar) 24 June 95this program is free.That includes the source code, and since it's so simple and smallprobably it should be considered public domain. But I'm not concernedabout legal matters and I've never worried about the differences between"free" and "public domain": in both cases, I'm the author and youhave some rights to use it, OK ?*/#define VM_COMPATIBLE#include <SCSI.h>typedef unsigned char byte;#define SCSI_ID 3	/* !!!! change this according to your needs.
