	 Boom! (4th of July)


About:

	You know that little 'star' that gets drawn in the corner 
of a Mac Window when a window is closed, in the GoAway Box ??  

	Now that we have PowerPC's, wouldn't it be cool to have a 
little more definitive feedback than that little blink ?

	This Hack was written start-to-finish  at MacHack 94 using 
the MetroWerks compilers. (well, I couldn't resist a few touch-
ups afterwards, but you get the idea...)

	You can see the animation by holding the shift key down, 
otherwise, nothing is touched (one test overhead, incentive to 
actually _install_ this thing!)
