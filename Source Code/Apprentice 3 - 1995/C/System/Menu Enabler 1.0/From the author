Menu Enabler is a small hack to let you select ANY menu item, even disabled ones.  Just throw the INIT in your system folder and restart.  This INIT should work on all Macintoshes; if it doesn’t work on yours, drop me a line (see addresses below).

The only neat thing I’ve discovered I can do with Menu Enabler (which is, in fact, the reason I wrote the program to begin with) is view my desktop by name, or kind, or small icon.  If you find any other neat things (easter eggs in certain programs?  don’t know of any yet...) please let me know.

Technical note #1: Don’t be surprised if programs crash when you select disabled menu items.  They are, after all, disabled for a reason.  All of the programs I’ve written crash if you select the disabled “Close” menu item when there are no open windows.

Technical note #2: Menu Enabler is implemented as a tail patch to MenuSelect.  As any good Macintosh programmer knows, tail patches are inherently evil bits of programming which may cause mirrors to crack, noses to expand, systems to crash, etc.  I haven’t encountered any problems using Menu Enabler, but Apple may decide to write the next version of system software to intentionally break this program.  So be it.
