It is an example of a self-disposing Notification request.  After the notification is posted there is no trace of it left on the machine (or hardly any).Notifier is completely self-contained.  You simply load the code resourceinto memory from your extension and pass it the address of a string to be reportedin a Notification Manager alert.  Since Notifier is a separate code resource itis only loaded into memory if it is needed, which should be rarely.  The extensionthat calls it can let itself be removed from memory.Notifier makes a copy of the string and sets up a Notification request block.  Ifit successfully adds this to the Notification queue by calling NMInstall it detachesitself.  The extension that has called Notifier should not detach itself if theerror is fatal.  After the Notification Manager has shown the alert it calls the notification responseroutine in the Notifier code resource.  This routine removes the nmRecord from thequeue by calling NMRemove and then it marks itself Purgeable, unlocks itself, and returns.  The result of being purgeable and unlocked is that the handle is quicklypurged from the system heap.  Thus Notifier leaves little or no trace of itself after it returns.See the files NotifierUnlock.c and NotifierTesterINIT.c for the source to the Notifier and an example of how to use it.This package includes source for two methods of creating self-disposing requests.There are several methods that have been used for creating self-disposing requests.  One method involves putting a bit of code in a low memory scratch areacalled ToolScratch and jumping to that code, which then disposes of the handle containing the nmRequest.  The other method puts the disposal code on the stack anduses an RTD instruction to clean up the stack.  Both of those methods use self-modifying code.  The Toolscratch method is vulnerable to interrupt code that might use that location for something and the RTD instruction is only available on 68020 and later computers.The unlocking method leaves a single used master pointer in the system heap.  I haveincluded a second source file NotifierToolScratch.c that disposes of a notificationrequest by the ToolScratch method.  I recommend that you use the Unlocking method but both seem to work.#endif
