Sleep Deprivation will cause your Macintosh to clear the screen with a cool graphic effect when it goes to sleep.  Obviously, this requires that you have a Macintosh that can sleep in the first place, like a Powerbook or a Duo or the like.  If you do, just throw this INIT into your system folder and restart.Changes in version 1.1:- added 42 new effects, for a total of 50- fixed an obscure incompatibility problem on 68000 machinesCOPYRIGHT NOTICES:Sleep Deprivation is copyright ©1993-4 Mark Pilgrim.
