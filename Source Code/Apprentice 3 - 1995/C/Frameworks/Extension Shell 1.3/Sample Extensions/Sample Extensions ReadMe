Sample Extensions ReadMe
------------------------

The Extension Shell package comes with 6 sample Extensions, as well as a framework you can use as a
basis for your own.

Each Extension has been chosen to illustrate one aspect of Extension Shell. One installs a trap patch (and
a block of code in the System heap), one a Gestalt selector, one a VBL task, one a Shutdown task, one a
low memory filter, and one a Time Manager task.

They all use a first-time-through flag mechanism to minimise calls to the address table: in most cases,
this is the most efficient way of avoiding a constant lookup.

The trap-patch example (BellTest) also shows how to extend the address table, as documented in
‘Extension Shell (Source) ReadMe’. It also shows how to load, and call, a raw block of code into the
System Heap. The shutdown task example (Shutdown Fade) also shows how to animate a sequence of icons.
The Time Manager example (MacCough) also extends the address table.

None of them are intended as ‘real’ Extensions - they're here by way of example...
