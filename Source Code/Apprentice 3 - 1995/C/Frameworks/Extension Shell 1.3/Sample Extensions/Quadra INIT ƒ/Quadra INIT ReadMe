Quadra INIT
-----------

Quadra INIT is an example of using Extension Shell to install, and replace, a Gestalt selector. It overrides
the gestaltMachineType selector, and makes your Mac think it's a Quadra.

Check the “About This Macintosh” menu item to confirm your new machine. This will probably cause all
sorts of horrible crashes, so please only use it as an example - it's not meant to be a ‘real’ Extension. I left
it installed for a couple of weeks to see what would die, and nothing actually fell over - but don't count on
it... :-)
