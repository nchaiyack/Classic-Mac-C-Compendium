This application doesn't // need this method (thats why its commented out) but its included here // to indicate how you support the "save cancel" feature of the Macintosh user interface.// This same function could be used in your Document subclass, but I tend to not // use it there because its safer to use the Document's destructor.  As a rule of // thumb, choose KillMeNext over the destructor in cases where the data to be freeed is// only referenced via the DWindow::fWindowPtr (which is deleted in DWinodw::KillMeNext).//Boolean DHLWindow::KillMeNext(void){	Boolean inheritedSuccess = FALSE;	if(fAlive)// only do stuff if obect is NOT in the DeadHandler list	{		if(inheritedSuccess = inherited::KillMeNext())// inherited returns FALSE if user cancels...		{			;// Kill your stuff here if your DWindow has things to			//  get rid of		}	}	return inheritedSuccess;}// end of KillMeNext method...*/
