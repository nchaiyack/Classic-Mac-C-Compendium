This is already in global coordinates, but the * tricky part is that it isn't valid if the window is invisible. * * If window's visible, the structure region's valid, so get the bounding box. * * If the window's not visible, fling it out into space, make it visible, get * the structure region bounding box, make it invisible again and restore it to * its normal position.  Use ShowHide() for this since  it doesn't change the * window's hiliting or position in the stacking order.  The rectangle * calculated this way has to be moved back, too, since it's obtained when the * window is in flung position. * * I have seen similar code that also saves and restored the window's userState, * but Inside Macintosh (Toolbox Essentials, p. 4-70) explicitly states that * the userState isn't modified when you just move a window, so I don't see the * point. */pascal voidSkelGetWindStructureRect (WindowPtr w, Rect *rp){Rect	content;	if (((WindowPeek) w)->visible)		*rp = (**(* (WindowPeek) w).strucRgn).rgnBBox;	else	{		SkelGetWindContentRect (w, &content);				/* get upper-left coords */		MoveWindow (w, kTranslate, content.top, false);		/* fling window */		ShowHide (w, true);		*rp = (**(* (WindowPeek) w).strucRgn).rgnBBox;		ShowHide (w, false);		MoveWindow (w, content.left, content.top, false);	/* unfling window */		OffsetRect (rp, content.left - kTranslate, 0);		/* unfling struct rect */	}}
