/* * Set hiliting value of control.  Differs from HiliteControl() in that * the control is not set it if it already has that value, in order to minimize * drawing.  Returns true if the value was actually changed, false if not. * * Returning the value can be useful in conjunction with push buttons surrounded * by a heavy outline.  When the button is dimmed, the outline should go dim. * When the button is made active, the outline should be black.  By knowing * whether the hiliting value actually changed, outline redrawing can be skipped * when it's unnecessary. */# include	"TransSkel.h"pascal BooleanSkelHiliteControl (ControlHandle ctrl, short hilite){	if ((**ctrl).contrlHilite != hilite)	{		HiliteControl (ctrl, hilite);		return (true);	}	return (false);}
