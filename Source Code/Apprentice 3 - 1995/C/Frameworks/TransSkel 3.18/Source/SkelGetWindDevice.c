/* * Get the device containing most of a window's content rectangle and the * largest usable rectangle on that device.  If the device is the main * device, the rectangle is adjusted not to contain the menu bar area. * * The result is used by TransSkel for window zooming.  Normally, the * caller adjusts the top of the rectangle to account for the title bar * height, then insets it by a few pixels in order to leave a little * space around the window edges.  SkelGetWindowDevice() itself does * not account for the title bar height.  That responsibility is * left with the caller, which can call SkelGetWindTitleHeight() to * find this out. * * Returns true if the window overlaps some device in its current * position.  False can be returned, for instance, if an application * saves document window positions and a document is saved while * positioned on a second monitor, then opened on a system that doesn't * have a second monitor. * * The returned device value will be nil on systems that don't have GDevices * (i.e.,, that don't support Color QuickDraw), even if the function result * is true. * * If the window does not overlap any device, the device and devRect arguments * are filled in with the values for the main device.  The rectangle can * be used to position the window so it can be made visible. * * If the caller is not interested in the device or rectangle, nil * can be passed instead of the address of a variable. * * References: TN TB 30, HIN 6, HIN 7. */# include	"TransSkel.h"pascal BooleanSkelGetWindowDevice (WindowPtr wind, GDHandle *gd, Rect *devRect){Rect	r;Boolean	isMain;Boolean	result;	/* get window content rect in global coordinates */	SkelGetWindContentRect (wind, &r);	result = SkelGetRectDevice (&r, gd, devRect, &isMain);	if (isMain && devRect != (Rect *) nil)		devRect->top += SkelQuery (skelQMBarHeight);	return (result);}
