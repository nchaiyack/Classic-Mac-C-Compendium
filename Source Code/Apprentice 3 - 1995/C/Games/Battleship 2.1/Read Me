Battleship 2.1
by Matthew Kavalauskas

This is the source code for Battleship 2.1 for the Macintosh.  It is done using THINK C version 5.0.  If you make any improvements/changes, I would love to see them, or if you would like a copy of the code, drop me a line.

This is my first real program for the Macintosh, so if you have any suggestions or comments, I would love to hear them.  After many people suggested that I should add more sounds, I did just that.  The version with sounds, however, is three times the size of the original version because sounds take up a lot of memory.  If you are interested in the small size (and you can use ResEdit or some other resource editor), the game will work if you remove the snd  resources.  Also, due to the increased size of the application, I am no longer including the source code with the application or vice versa.  If you are interested in the either source code or the actual game, the latest version will usually be on America Online, or you can drop me a line and I will get a copy to you.

This is choiceware.  If you want, send me some money ($5.00 or you could pay my tuition bills instead); however, as I am I college student, I know I don't want to pay for anything.  But if you play this game, PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS PROGRAM!  Even a simple e-mail will do.  "I played Battleship.  It is ______ ."  Fill the blank with the adjective of your choice.

Battleship may not be sold; however, feel free to give it to your friends/acquaintences/strangers on the street.  It has been fully tested, but I take no responsibility for any malfunctions/crashes that may occur.
