.LPEach argument [???] will be taken to be a specification of a playerwho will participate in the game.  The format of a player spec is.IP.B[name@]host[+\fIn\fP].LPwhere \fIhost\fP is the name of a host.If \fIn\fP is given, it is the desired "advantage" for the player(higher gives the player more to start with)..TP 5.B \-e \fInumber\fPsets the number of machine players not attached to displays..LPGeneral options:.TP 5.B \-c \fInumber\fPsets checkpointing to occur every \fInumber\fP turns..TP 5.B \-f \fIname\fPreads the file named \fIname\fP, interpreting as a game..TP 5.B \-g \fIname\fPreads the game named \fIname\fP..TP 5.B \-helpdisplays help info..TP 5.B \-join \fIgame\fP[not implemented yet].TP 5.B \-L\fIpathname\fPsets the location to search for game files to \fIpathname\fP..TP 5.B \-mail[not implemented yet].TP 5.B \-wsuppresses warnings..LPVariant options:.TP 5.B \-M \fIwidth\fP[x\fIheight\fP]generates a random map of the given size.  The size must be at least 5x5,although some periods will impose additional constraints on the lower bound.In theory, there is no upper bound (but 200x200 would be huge)..TP 5.B \-t \fInumber\fPlimits the total time of play for each side to \fInumber\fP minutes per side.Time is only counted while actually waiting for input..TP 5.B \-vmake the entire world seen by all players at the outset.This is useful if exploration is deemed to be time-consuming,or if the world is already known to everybody.Some games have this permanently enabled..TP 5.B \-vvmake everything seen all the time.Some games have this permanently enabled..TP 5.B \-v\fIvariant-name[=variant-value]\fPdo game-design-defined variants.The command "*conq -g game -help" will list the available variants..LPDesigning and debugging options:.TP 5.B \-designenables designer mode, if available..TP 5.B \-D[-GM]enables debugging output..TP 5.B \-R \fInumber\fPsets the random seed to \fInumber\fP..SH EXAMPLES.TP 8.B*conqOne human on local display, one mplayer, 60x30 random world.TP 8.B*conq -g craterOne human vs one machine, playing the "crater lake" game.TP 8.B*conq -e 2 -M 35x35One human, two machines, 35x35 random world.TP 8.B*conq -e 6 -g earth1Seven players (6 machine, 1 human), all playingon a 360x122 map of the earth with present-day cities.
