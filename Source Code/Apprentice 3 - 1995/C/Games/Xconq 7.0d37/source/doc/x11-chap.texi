[etc]Each map may have one @i{current position} and one @i{current unit}.The current position is specially highlighted, and the info subwindowdisplays information about it.  If in addition there is a currentunit at the current position, then it will be highlighted ratherthan the entire cell, and the info subwindow will describe itin detail.[details/example of info subwindow]@subsection ScrollingIt will nearly always be the case that the world is too large to beseen all at once.  You can scroll around in two ways.First, if you are in survey mode, and click near any edge of theview, @i{Xconq} will put the position you clicked at the centerof the view.  By clicking in the same place repeatedly, you can``walk'' the view in any desired direction.If you want to go directly to a particular part of the world,use the panner in the bottom right corner of the map window.To use the panner, click and drag the shadowed box inside thepanner.  The panner is sized to match the map, and the shadowedbox is sized to match the view, so you can get a general ideaof much is visible of the whole world.@subsection View Control PopupIf you click the button ``More...'' in the leftside controls,you will get a popup dialog that is a full set of viewing controls.Unlike the leftside view controls, these do not act at once;instead, you toggle them on or off, then click on ``Apply'' or``Done'' to see the effects.  This allows you to make a number ofchanges and have the map be redrawn only once.  ``Apply'' leavesthe popup in place, while ``Done'' makes it go away.  You may leavethe popup up permanently and continue play, if you like.Note that each map will have its own separate view control popup,and that they're not clearly distinguished from each other.Fortunately, these only affect display, not the game itself.@section PlayThe basic idea of play is to be in move mode, let the programselect the next unit to do something, then give it a command,either by clicking the mouse or by typing on the keyboard.Each map may have two modes; ``survey'' and ``move''.In survey mode, the default actions are not to do anything,while in move mode, the default actions are to do things.This principle applies to both mouse and keyboard commands.For instance, 'h' in survey mode moves the current position westby one cell, but in move mode it causes the current unit to try tomove west by one cell.@subsection Using the Mouse - er - PointerAlthough in classic X style, all the actions may be arbitrarilyrebound, for simplicity the default @i{Xconq} setup uses theleft button for the most important actions.@subsection Using the KeyboardThe general commands all work as described in Chapter 2.Commands that work on units will be applied to the current unitof the map that the pointer is over.  If the map has nocurrent unit, then you will get an error message.Commands that need further input will generally request it fromthe prompt subwindow that is sandwiched between the history subwindowand the date subwindow.  You do not need to put the cursor overthe prompt window to type into it however; when a prompt is up,any typed characters will be considered to be part of the answerto the prompt.@node Designing@chapter Designing with X11 XconqThere are two ways to get into designer's mode; you can either specify@samp{-design} on the command line, or else enter the long command@samp{design} after doing the {o} command.  When you do either ofthese, several things will happen: the side list will mark your sideas a designer, the ``see all'' button in the view control panel willbe enabled, and you will get a popup with designer's tools.The popup applies to all maps equally.The identification in the side list is for the benefit of other players,since it is actually possible to enable designing in a multi-player game.@c but maybe should disable, or else enable for all players@c simultaneously??  Somebody should enable designing, hack a bit,@c then switch back before anybody else in the game noticed...The ``see all'' view control allows you to see everything accurately.It is switchable so you can compare what things look like to the playervs what they are in reality.@c need side view painting here tooShortcuts:* Clicking on the "sides" subwindow will select the current side.* Clicking on the "unit types" subwindow will select the current unittype.* Clicking a cell with the right mouse button in terrain-drawing modewill select the current terrain.* Clicking a unit with the right mouse button in unit-adding mode willselect the current unit type.* Clicking a unit with the right mouse button in people-drawing modewill select the current side.* Clicking a cell with the right mouse button in feature-drawing modewill select the current feature.@section Xshowimf   Install the resource files XShowimf.ad and XShowimf-co.ad asXShowimf and XShowimf-co [or XShowimf-color, depending on the value ofthe customization resource] in the proper directory, or load therelevant file with "xrdb -merge".   Display of three-color images (mono+mask) is controlled by theresource "maskColor" (see XShowimf-color.ad) or by the command-lineargument "-mc"   On a sun, compile with gcc, not with cc.   To use as an image family editor, use asmkdir tmpxshowimf [imf/xbm/xpm files...] -o tmpdir &(cd tmpdir; xpaint) &   and see help window;  don't forget to "update" edited files.@c should add a troubleshooting chapter
