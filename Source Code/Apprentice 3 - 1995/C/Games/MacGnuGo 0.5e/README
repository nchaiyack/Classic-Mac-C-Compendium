/*                GNU GO - the game of Go (Wei-Chi)                Version 1.1   last revised 3-1-89           Copyright (C) Free Software Foundation, Inc.                      written by Man L. Li                      modified by Wayne Iba                    documented by Bob Webber                    NeXT version by John Neil                    Mac version by Ron Nicholson, 93Nov16This is a Macintosh port of the Next version of GNU GO.  It's been tested withSystem versions 6.0.3, 7.0 and 7.1 on Mac Plus, SE/30 and Duos machines.The interface is a quick & dirty one.  There is no documentation for the Macversion.  It does play board sizes from 5x5 to 19x19 and uses Chinese scoring. It's probably most useful for very beginning beginners.The play quality is very poor compared to that of commercial Go programs. GnuGois  about 4 kyu weaker than wally.c, though it could beat me when I was firstlearning.  I did make some minor improvements to keep GnuGo from making so manyrandom moves near the end of the game.  You still need to kill any dead groupswith several liberties ramaining for the automatic scoring to work.Like other Gnu software, it's infected by the Free Software Foundation legalvirus.  The copyright and warranties are in the file "COPYING". Please read ifyou plan on modifying or redistributing this program. The source for use with Think C 6.0.1 is included.  There is also a makefilefor a tty version that I've tested on NextStep and HP-UX machines.Porting GnuGo has served its purpose in helping me to learn how to play Go. Ifsomeone would like to add some pretty graphics, or features like Save Game andRestore Game to the menu, please feel free to do so; I'll provide assistance ifnecessary.  My thanks to all beta tester and Go mentors.  rhn@netcom.com---From the original Gnu Go README:This program is the updated version of Hugo (Version 1.0).  It is anattempt to start a free program to play Go.  The idea is based on thearticle "Programming the Game of Go. Byte, Vol.6 No.4" by J. K. Millen.Currently, this program only understands basic Go rules and play skills.It counts the number of liberty for each board piece.  Computer move isgenerated by choosing among several possible moves to attack the opponent,defense own pieces and match playing patterns.  If no good move is foundthen random move will be generated.  It doesn't have the concept of eyealthough it will try to form one.The program is written in C running on Sun and IBM PC.  The only differenceis the function to get system time as the seed for the random numbergenerator.  It can easily ported to other systems by changing this function.Computer Innovation C86 compiler is used for the PC version.  To use otherC compilers, simple change is required.You are encouraged to send in enhencement, suggestion, bug/fix for thisprogram.  Future release can be obtained from Free Software Foundation andusenet rec.games.go newsgroup.This package contains the following files:README - you are reading it.COPYING - GNU general public licensegnugo.src - complete source and makefile should compile under Unix          and on a Macintosh using Think C 6.0.1---This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modifyit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation - version 1.This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty ofMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
