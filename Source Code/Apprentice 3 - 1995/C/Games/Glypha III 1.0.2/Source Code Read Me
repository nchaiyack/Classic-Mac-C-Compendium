About the Glypha III Source Code
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


>>>   This contains the complete source code (C text files), resource (ResEdit format), and project (CodeWarrior 5) for Glypha III.  An arcade game.

>>>   The project is included - if you can't read it, it's a Metrowerk's CodeWarrior 5 file.  If you want to create your own project, include all the .c files, the resource file and any sort of Mac-specific library you need.

>>>   The headers (Mac headers) assumed are the new Apple Universal headers.

>>>   There isn't a lot of documentation throughout the code - there is some though.  It's pretty clean code though so I think it's self-explanatory.  BTW, is it obvious that my roots are in Pascal?

>>>   Feel free to borrow what code you want from it.  There are some nice Prefs routines and a decent 2-channel sound engine (suing priorities and callbacks).

>>>   Have fun with it.  I'm offering this code to the Mac community becuase I've always believed in giving something back.  I was helped along on my way by countless people who freely gave advice, routines, or pointers to books and articles.  I always found source code to be one of the best "instructors" though.  So here is a complete Mac game.  I can say that if I had had THIS 9 years ago, it would have saved me a lot of grief.  I hope it helps others who are just beginning to write games get past the mechanical tedium of programming.  I've never felt that there was any advantage in hoarding programming secrets from others.  I don't even have any problem with releasing source code to my commercial games, but the publishers....  Actually though, many of the routines in here were pulled straight out of my libraries that I use in Glider PRO, etc.  So, although I offer the code freely and don't impose any conditions on using it, I would encourage you to try to enrich the development community in any way you feel you can.

>>>   If anyone feels compelled to update or expand upon this game with this code (like adding two-player or network support) I would encourage you to put it to the Mac community through Usenet forums or other - see if there is support for the changes.  Of course you should probably make your code changes available and perhaps the game can go to 2.0, 3.0, etc. with different developers picking up with the code where the last developer left off.
