BinHex Code: full C source code for BinHex and un-BinHex
PowerHex: A simple, sample app that has a nice threaded
     interface.  (only BinHexes - not finished)
     (with C source - 68K and PPC)
DropHex: A simple, drag n drop, sample app that will BinHex
     and un-BinHex a file.  (with C source - 68K and PPC)

I hereby place this code fully within the Public Domain,
with the hope that if anybody uses it, it won't suck.

If you find a use for this code, and your a kind hearted
person, drop me a line.  I'll take comments, compliments 
as well as criticisms!


Pros: The native encoder/decoder both process >1 Megabyte/Second 
      on most PowerMacs  (except when they are waiting for
      filesystem!)

Cons: But, ...I thought my code was perfect!


Disclaimer:  Although I have heavily tested the code (the
BinHex code, NOT the demo apps!) it may still suck.  If
you can find (and reproduce) a bug in the actual encoder
(or decoder) I will gladly fix it free of charge.


Thanks, enjoy, and happy coding!
