/* GIF.c */#include "GIF.h"// ----- A GIF reading routine - by François Pottier, 15/12/93// ----- Originally based on code by Patrick J. Naughton, thoroughly modified since then.// ----- Input : a file specification and a flag longword to be passed to NewGWorld// ----- The file size is also given as input because the caller (LoadFile) happens to have it at hand.// ----- Output : an 8 bit GWorld with the picture. Pixels locked.// ----- The total amount of temporary storage that was used is also returned.// ----- We need five chunks of memory to decompress the picture. We take them from temporary memory.extern	OSErr	gError;											/* Imported from LoadFile.c in order to */extern	short	gMessage;											/* be able to report errors */// ----- A small note about programming style : I know all this is very bad programming. I would have liked to use// ----- nested subroutines, but C doesn't have them. I could have allocated all my vars in a struct and passed them along to every// ----- subroutine, but it seemed painful, so I finally chose to use macros. What's more, this code is optimized for speed (or at// ----- least it tries to be), so it isn't very readable. My apologies.// ----- Also, I don't understand very well *how* the LZW decompression works... So it might be possible to make it simpler.// ----- May 5th, 1994 : discovered a bug which caused curAddr to go too far and write one byte beyond the end of the pixmap.// ----- I don't know the Right Way to fix it, so I just put a range check before writing to the pixmap. See below.// ----- Various definitions#define 		ColorMapMask		0x80#define		ImageSeparator		0x2C#define		ExtensionIntroducer	0x21#define		NullBlock			0x00#define		InterlaceMask		0x40#define		BufferSize		8192								/* May be freely modified */#define		abort(x)			{ gMessage = x; goto end; }#define		Check(x)			if (e) abort(x)							/* this means return e */#define		Read(c, buf)		count = c;																	\							e = FSRead (refNum, &count, buf);			/* Read the requested number of bytes */	\							/*Check(strCantRead)*/															\							FileSize -= count						/* And note that we have read them */						#define		NextByte(b)		Read(1, &b)#define		Skip(n)			e = SetFPos (refNum, fsFromMark, n);		/* Skip n bytes */						\							Check(strCantSetFPos)																	\							FileSize -= n							/* And note that we have read them */							// ----- Here is how things work.
