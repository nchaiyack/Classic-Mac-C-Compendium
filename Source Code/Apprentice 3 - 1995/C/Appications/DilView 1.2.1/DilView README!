You can mark/unmark files by clicking the box to the left of the filename.  - everything else should be intuitive (-;Credit where credit is due: - Thanks to François Pottier and Patrick Naughton for excellent examples of GIF decoding,- Manuel Veloso, whose SFMultiGet graces my “Open Multiple...” code,- Paul DuBois for TransSkel, an application framework that de-rusts the ToolBox,- The Free Programmer’s Union (FPU) for Beta testing,- Faisal Jawdat (fiz), for many helpful suggestions and bug reports (er, documenting features, that is)- and Scott Adams for inspiration!Known features [bugs]:- files must have a type of ‘GIFf’ for DilView to recognize them.  (Use JPEGView’s GIF Autotyper if this is a problem)- any GIF file may be opened (I could check for the 780x277 resolution, but don’t want to set anything in stone just in case the format changes), and will be made 780x277.- if you view a file with the window partially offscreen and then move it onscreen, the previously unvisible area is blank.  This is my fault for being nice to the user.  In order to give the illusion that my program is responsive, I decode the gif offscreen to a big buffer, dither it onscreen, then store a copy of the screen so if I need to update later I can just use the copy rather than re-dither (a somewhat slow process).  If I dither to the buffer then copy onscreen there is a noticable delay between selecting a file and getting it onscreen.. I can also dither onscreen then dither offscreen to the buffer, but that slows responsiveness to other events. - All heck will break loose if the disk fills up (if memory gets tight it swaps out chunks to a scratch file, reading them back in again when needed). History:- v1.2.2 corrected a typo in the about box! (whoops!)- v1.2.1 fixed a bug that caused occasional crashes with multi-file drag & drops. - v1.2 added support for Drag & Drop, Apple Events, and basic AppleScript.- v1.1 implemented next/previous to simplify multiple viewing. (fiz’s idea (-: )- v1.0.1 fixed an incompatibility with System 7.5- v1.0 was the first public release, but third re-write of DilView.  The first was mainly an experiment in GIF decoding, the second implemented all the features you see in v1.0, and the third did it right (-;Legal stuff:- Under no circumstances shall Darrell Anderson be liable for any incidental, special, or consequential damages that result from the use or disuse of this software.- DilView may be distributed freely without modification and with this documentation.- Dilberts, as downloaded from clari.feature.dilbert, may not.
