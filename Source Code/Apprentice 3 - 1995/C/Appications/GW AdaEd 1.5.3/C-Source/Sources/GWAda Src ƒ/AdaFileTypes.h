GADA differentiates between these		two based on filename extention.  .lis files are read		in as listings, and .ada are read in as source files.		3) Library files are files created by the adafront,		adagen, and adabind programs.		4) The predef library has it's own type of file/icon,		so that the user can differentiate it from other		files.		5)	Output files, created by adaexec are of type 'TEXT'		also.--------------------------------------------------------*/void	FileType(long type);
