If all the text wont fit using the current style, condensed is  *  next tried. If the text still doesn't fit then the left n characters  *  that will fit are drawn. To indicated to the user that not all the  *  text is being displated an ellipsis is drawn an the end of the  *  truncated text. *  *  Copyright C) 1992 by Brown University.
