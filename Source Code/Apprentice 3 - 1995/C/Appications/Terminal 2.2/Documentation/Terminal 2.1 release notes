Changes between  "Terminal" 2.0  (November 1990)  and  2.1  (December 1990)
===========================================================================

Terminal 2.1 corrects some serious bugs in the ZModem receive functions
that were discovered shortly after I released version 2.0. Sorry for those
bugs, and many thanks to those who signaled them to me. I should have
tested the ZModem file transfers more extensively.

ERROR -108 (memFullErr)

When doing a ZModem download with MacBinary files, Terminal would not
always succeed in extracting the file from the MacBinary envelope. The
error message was "error #-108": memFullErr (not enough memory available).
This same problem appeared also when manually trying to extract from a
MacBinary file from the "File" menu.

In both cases the same function was called, which temporarily allocated a
big memory buffer to read the file. This function made sure to leave some
memory available, but it appeared that this was not enough in some cases.
The size of this reserve memory has been increased, and I hope this solves
the problem.

ZMODEM RECEIVE CRC ERROR

This was a bug of the type: "if error then no error". The ZModem receive
function did not correctly compare the received CRC with its calculated
CRC, and every frame received was considered ok. Now Terminal correctly
detects bad CRCs.
___________________________________________________________________________
ZMODEM RECEIVE LOST CHARACTERS

The ZModem receive function did flush the serial input buffer at the wrong
moment, so that the first characters of incoming frames were sometimes
lost. Coupled with the previous problem, this made frames acceptable that
were to short (e.g. 990 bytes instead of 1024 bytes).
___________________________________________________________________________
LINEFEED CHARACTERS IN RECEIVED TEXT FILES WITH ZMODEM

Terminal ignored the ZCNL conversion option (convert linefeed to local end
of line convention) in the ZFILE header when receiving a text file. (Note
that "White Knight 11.01" also ignores the ZCNL conversion option!). There
is at least one other Macintosh program ("ZTerm 0.85") that sends linefeed
characters for text files, and I guess that all UNIX "sz" programs also
send linefeed characters for text files. Now if Terminal sees that the ZCNL
conversion option in ZFILE header is set it will convert the received
linefeed characters to carriage return characters, which is the end of line
convention used on the Macintosh.
___________________________________________________________________________
ZMODEM AUTORECEIVE

I have been told that the ZModem autoreceive feature did not always work. I
could not reproduce that problem. Terminal detects the following sequence
to automatically start ZModem receive:

	'*' ctrl-X "B00000000000000" ctrl-M

This character sequence must be received without any errors.
