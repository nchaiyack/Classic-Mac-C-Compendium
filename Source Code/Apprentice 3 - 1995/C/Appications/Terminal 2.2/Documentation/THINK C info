===========================================================================Terminal 2.2                              THINK C 5.02 project organization===========================================================================Create a project named "Terminal ¹".The resources needed are in the file "Terminal ¹.rsrc".(Note: when running in the context of the THINK C project you may need toincrease the partition size)Options...	Compiler Flags:		Check Pointer Types						Require PrototypesSet Project Type...	Application	File Type:			APPL	Creator:			ET_T	Partition (K)		160	MF Attrs			5880	MultiFinder-Aware								Background Null Events								Suspend & Resume Events								32-Bit CompatiblePrecompile "MacHeaders.c" into "MacHeaders" (in the project folder, don'tuse the "MacHeaders" from the THINK C folder).Note: If you don't have the Communications Toolbox library and includefiles, don't define the symbol "USECTB" in "main.h" before building theapplication. Without the Communications Toolbox, only the modem port andthe printer port are recognized as serial devices.Segment #2----------ANSIÑsmallCommToolbox			(see note above)MacTrapsMain.cUtilities.cSegment #3----------CancelDialog.cCRC.cDocument.cFile.cFormatStr.cInterp.cMacBinary.cMacros.cMySF.cPort.cProcedure.cScript.cScroll.cText.cSegment #4----------Init.cSegment #5----------OtherOptions.cPopup.cPortOptions.cProtocolOptions.cSendOptions.cTerminalOptions.cXOptions.cZOptions.cSegment #6----------About.cSegment #7----------XModem.cSegment #8----------CisB.cSegment #9----------ZModem.cWhen the application is built use "ResEdit" to set the attributes of thefollowing CODE resources.
