===========================================================================

This file describes the bug corrections and the improvements that where
made to "Terminal" from version 1.9 to 2.0. The following text should help
you to decide if you want to download the newer version. Bug reports and
suggestions for improvement are always welcome. All my excuses to those
people who suggested improvements that could not (yet) be implemented in
this version. And thanks to all those who send reports and suggestions.

___________________________________________________________________________
XMODEM

XModem receive did not close files that needed only one block.
___________________________________________________________________________
SYSTEM 7

Corrected a font problem that prevented Terminal for running under System 7
(7.0b1). Increased Terminal's default partition size from 128 to 160K.
___________________________________________________________________________
MENUS

The script menu, the macro menu and the port pop-up menu, now display
correctly any names that might include the menu meta characters ( ';' '^'
'!' '<' '/' '(' ).
___________________________________________________________________________
SETTINGS FILE

Volumes are now saved by name not by reference number. The settings file
structure has changed.
___________________________________________________________________________
ZMODEM

Added ZModem file transfers.
___________________________________________________________________________
CONTROL CHARACTERS

Now it's possible to use the option key or the command as control key for
those keyboards that lack a control key. On keyboards with a control key
all characters that need the option key are now available. Previously the
option key always acted as a control key, creating unaccessible characters
on international keyboards.
___________________________________________________________________________
SCRIPTS

Scripts can now be executed by opening them from the Finder (i.e. double
clicking on a script file). There is a new option in the File menu: "Kiss
script file" to change creator of TEXT files to Terminal's creator. Hold
down option (or shift, or command) key to revert to TEXT.
___________________________________________________________________________
HANDSHAKE

XON/XOFF, CTS only, DTR only, CTS&DTR handshake or no handshake can be used
all the time (not just while sending text files as previously).
___________________________________________________________________________
OTHER SERIAL DEVICES

Terminal can now use all possible serial ports, not just the modem or
printer port, if the Communications Tool Box is available and if those
serial drivers are correctly registered with the Communications Tool Box.
___________________________________________________________________________
CONFIGURATION RESOURCE

The structure of the 'CNFG' (id 128) resource has changed. The font is now
stored by name instead of by number. Added 'TMPL' resource to edit 'CNFG'
resource with ResEdit.
___________________________________________________________________________
INTRINSIC FUNCTIONS

You must review your scripts that use the following instrinsic functions:
    download()      Changed
    protocol()      Changed
    setup()         Changed
    text()          Changed
    upload()        Changed
    xyparms()       New
    zparms()        New
___________________________________________________________________________
ICONS

Terminal's icons have changed. There are now distinct icons for:
    Terminal, the application
    Terminal Settings, settings file
    MacBinary, files created with the "Make MacBinary..." menu command
    Partial ZModem, uncomplete files received by ZModem
    Script, script TEXT files
So if you have had an old version of Terminal on your disk, please rebuild
your Desktop file so that the Finder becomes aware of the new file types
and icons.
___________________________________________________________________________
COMPILER

Terminal can be compiled with THINK C 4.02 (or THINK C 4.04 for System 7)
or MPW 3.2 C.
