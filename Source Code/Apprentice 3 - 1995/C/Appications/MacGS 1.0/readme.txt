This is the current release of Macintosh port of Ghostscript.  Itcontains both pre-built versions and the sources.The release consists of the following files:    macgs-v1.0-files.sit  - Ghostscript files and documentation    macgs-v1.0-68k.sit    - the application compiled for 68020 or better    macgs-v1.0-ppc.sit    - the application compiled for PPC machines    macgs-v1.0-fonts.sit  - the standard Ghostscript 3.0 fonts    macgs-v1.0-src.sit    - the source files    manual.txt            - the manual as unformatted text    readme.txt            - this fileThese files are StuffIt archives.  If you do not have a program toexpand these, you should get the free StuffIt Expander program fromyour favorite Macintosh archive.[1] Unstuff macgs-v1.0-files.sit.  It will create a folder namedGhostscript on your disk.[2] Unstuff one of the two application files, macgs-v1.0-68k.sit ormacgs-v1.0-ppc.sit into the Ghostscript folder.  Remember to onlyunstuff one of them!  The Finder gets confused if you have more thanone version of an application on a disk.[3] Unstuff macgs-v1.0-fonts.sit into the Ghostscript folder as well.This exactly the same collection of fonts asghostscript-fonts-std-3.0.tar.gz, just in a format most Macintosh userscan handle.You will only need macgs-v1.0-src.sit if you are planning on compilingthe program yourself.  See the manual included with the files archive formore details.When you have gotten all these, please see the included manual (in thefiles archive) for more information.
