These files contain the BETA version of the documentation for NCSA Telnet 2.6.

They do not look exactly like the master copies as the documentation was produced in FrameMaker 4.0.  The files you have are a result of a fairly accurate conversion process.

The final documentation will be available in html, FrameMaker, and another format (possibly Common Ground).

Please mail any comments or errors to mactel@ncsa.uiuc.edu.
