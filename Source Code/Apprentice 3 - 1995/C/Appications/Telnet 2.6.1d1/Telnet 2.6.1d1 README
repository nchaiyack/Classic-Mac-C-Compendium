4/26/94	NCSA Telnet 2.6.1d1 for the Macintosh release notes:

These release notes contain the following information:
	¥	Changes since the last version
	¥	Compiler compatability chart for this source release
	¥	Telnet release schedule
	¥	Goals left for current release
	¥	Bug list
	¥	Future features list
	
Changes in 2.6.1d1:
-------------------
The port to PowerPC has almost been completed.  Currently Authentication and
Encryption are not available while running on the PPC.  2.6.1d1PPC has been
quite stable for me.  Please let me know if the PPC version shows any bugs
that aren't in the 68K version.

Fixed the FTP client 'lls' bug.  I wasn't really looking at this code
currently, but the MW PPC compiler gave me a warning MPW and TC never did,
thus leading me to the cause of this bug. (MW satisfied customer #1000000001)

Compiler compatability for 2.6.1d1:
-----------------------------------
TC 7.0: Yes		MPW C3.3.1: No		MW 68K 1.0a4: No	MW PPC 1.0a4: Yes
(MPW C compiler bug prevents compiling of rsmac.c)
(Strange hang ocurring under binary made by MW 68K [probably my fault])

NCSA Telnet for the Macintosh release schedule:
-----------------------------------------------	
Don't bet the farm on these dates.  For entertainment purposes only.

2.6 final documentation		Mid-May			(unconfirmed)
2.6.1						May 14, 1994	(firm)
2.7							Septmber, 1994	(if public release is made)
3.0							Mid-Dec, 1994	(firm)

It looks like 3.0 or 3.0.1 will be the final release of NCSA Telnet for
the Macintosh. There is also a possibility that Telnet development will
cease at 2.6.1.

Goals for 2.6.1:
----------------
¥	PPC version completed.  (minus Authentication/Encryption)
¥	Fix the VAX/VMS VT220 problems.
¥	Fix the NeXT interaction problems.
¥	Clean up the segmentation a little bit more and do some memory cleanup.
¥	URL command-double-click support (?)

This is the list of all Telnet bugs known to NCSA, feel free to mail us if
you find others:

Crashes:
¥	Crash if window size is changed under low memory conditions

¥	Window positioning
¥	Need to add blocksize pref
¥	Telnet doesn't constrain saved window positions to available desktop

		problem)
¥	Type during paste bug
¥	Occasional problems getting the preferences to "stick"

¥	Certain macro sequences are not sent correctly (?)
¥	\r,\n, and \t cannot appear in a Macro sequence

¥	Bold font problems need to be solved
¥	Tabs don't work completely
¥	Clear whole text cell

In progress for 2.7:
