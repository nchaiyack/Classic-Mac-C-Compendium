Ok, so I didn't get back to work right away.  Anyway, I implemented the
internal constructs I spoke of in the header comments, so now
InnerInterpreter parses if-else-then and do-loop constructs into a sort
of sub-program within the program.  The actions have yet to be filled in
and the outer interpreter needs to be modified to correctly collect the
input in a way that makes sense to the InnerInterpreter (i.e. handle
multi-line input).
