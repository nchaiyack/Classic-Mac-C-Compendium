This directory contains a couple of dialog boxes, including a
load/save file dialog, for Tkinter.  The code was originally written
by Ken Howard; Graham Matthews added comments, reformatted it and
added code to the utils.py and assert.py files.

The directory contains the following files:

alert.py    - Base and derived classes for error/warning dialogs.
assert.py   - The usual debugging style assertion routines.
dialog.py   - Base class for a modal and non-modal dialogs.
filedlg.py  - Contains a load file and save file dialogs.
loadfile.py - Demo application.
utils.py    - A simple utility file.

To test: 

1. Run loadfile.py 
2. Click the load file button.
3. Play with the load file dialog.
4. If a choice is made and the dialog is dismissed, the button label
   will reflect the choice.

Alternatively:

	from tkinter import *
        from filedlg import SaveFileDialog

	T = Toplevel()
        d = SaveFileDialog(T, "Save As", "*.ws")
        if d.Show() == 1:
                doc = d.GetFileName()
                d.DialogCleanup()
                print "doc"
        else:
                d.DialogCleanup()
