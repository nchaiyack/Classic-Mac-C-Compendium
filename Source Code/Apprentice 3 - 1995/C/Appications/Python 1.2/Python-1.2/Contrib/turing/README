I thought I would upload the Turing machine simulation that I wrote.
I like this demo because I found that Python was the easiest language
to write this program in.  (It was originally a 3 file C++ program; the
Python is the shortest version of the program.  This is due to the powerful
python library (very good regular expressions), the high level datatypes, and
of course the functional programming stuff I added!) 

Actually, The Icon version is a smaller due to the __cram everything in one
line if you can__ style of Icon, but I like this version the best.

To test:

    % python turing.py double aaa

Should print:

    ### aaaaaa
	^
