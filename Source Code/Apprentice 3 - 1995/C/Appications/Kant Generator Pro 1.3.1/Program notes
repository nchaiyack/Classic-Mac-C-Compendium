Kant Generator Pro 1.3.1June 26, 1995Copyright ©1994-5, Mark PilgrimWhat you got:- The "Modules ƒ" folder contains external modules which you can use to generate all sorts of things.  The folder should be in the same folder as the Kant Generator Pro application, and you should not change the folder name.- The "Modules ƒ copy" folder contains copies of all the modules in the "Modules ƒ" folder.  The module editor saves any changes you make automatically, so I’m providing backups of the modules for people (like me) who hate making backups.  Kant Generator Pro will never touch this folder or any of the files in it.  You can put this folder anywhere you like (including into the Trash) and rename it to your heart’s content.- The "Scripting ƒ" folder contains a sample script for controlling Kant Generator Pro via Applescript®.  It is fully commented and shows you everything you can make Kant Generator Pro do.  To use it, you will need AppleScript® and a script editor, neither of which is included in this package.- The "GNU General Public License" document contains lots of legalese regarding your rights of modifying and redistributing Kant Generator Pro.  Read it if you plan on redistributing Kant Generator Pro in a software collection or modifying and re-releasing Kant Generator Pro yourself.  A friend of mine (who has most of the stuff I’ve ever written) recently searched his hard drives and found 19 copies of this file, which is probably somewhat excessive.  If you already have a copy, feel free to delete this one; it hasn’t changed in almost three years.- The Kant Generator Pro application is what makes it all happen.Improvements since version 1.2:- Scripting support.  For all you AppleScript® tech-heads.  See the sample script in the "Scripting ƒ" folder for all the details.- Speech Manager support.  Install Apple’s Speech Manager and listen to the voice of Reason speak your generated text back to you.- A new-and-improved self-integrity checker.  So what?  Well, now you can change the memory allocation from the Finder’s “Get Info” window and Kant Generator Pro won’t complain that it’s been altered.  Rejoice!- A new module, Swedish Kant: a combination of Kant and the Swedish Chef.  Enjoy.- A new generator option, probable text.  See the Syntax test module for an example.  (Thanks to Mike W. Miller for this suggestion.)- Printable modules, background music, support for multiple open documents, and much, much more.  (Well, not that much more.)Notes on the modules:Kant Generator Pro has the built-in capability to generate enormous amounts of Kantian gibberish, but if you’d like to play with generating your own text, it also lets you create, edit, and use external modules.  There are several modules included in this release:Kant: this is exactly the same as the built-in Kant module, except that you can edit it.  The most general reference is &section.Swedish Kant: this is the same as the Kant module, except that all references names and text have been converted to mock Swedish Chef (as featured in my program Dialectic, which should be available wherever you got this package).  The most general reference is &secshun.Husserl: a module which emulates Edmund Husserl, a 20th-century phenomenologist.  The most general reference is &section.Thank You: a module which generates thank-you notes for all occasions.  The most general reference is &thank-you-note.Excuses, excuses: a module which generates for excuses explaining exactly why you can’t come to work.  The most general reference is &Yet-Another-Excuse.  Written by Mike W. Miller.Math: a module which generates algebraic equations using +, -, *, /, parentheses, and three variables X, Y, and Z.  The most general reference is &term.  Written by David Scheidt (the same friend who discovered that he had 19 copies of the GPL).Palindrome: a modules which generates palindromes (strings which spell the same backwards and forwards).  The most general (and only) reference is &palindrome.  Written by David Scheidt.Pascal: a module which generates syntactically correct statements in the Pascal programming language.  The most general reference is &pstate.  Written by David Scheidt.Parentheses: a module which generates strings of balanced parentheses.  The most general reference is &balanced-parens.  Written by David Scheidt.Syntax test: this is a sample module which gives examples of the different forms of syntax which Kant Generator Pro can deal with.  All the references are relevant, but you won’t get much out of them unless you look at them in the module editor first.If you’d like to create your own modules, poking around with these should be enough to get you started.  There are several pages of help in the Kant Generator Pro application which talk about building modules, and I also support balloon help for all the menus.  If you’re still confused, drop me a line (my e–mail address is in the application’s help section) and I’ll try to help.-Mark Pilgrim    6/26/95
