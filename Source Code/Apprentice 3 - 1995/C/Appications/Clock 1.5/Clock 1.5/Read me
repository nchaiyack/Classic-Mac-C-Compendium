CLOCK 1.5written by Mark ButkiewiczCLOCK is a simple, but useful little clock.  Since the introductionof System 7.5 which has a built-in clock in the menubar (it'sabout time) CLOCK is pretty much worthless, but hey, it's free sowho cares!CLOCK uses a minimum of:			- Desk Space			- Disk Space			- Memory Space			- CPU TimeFor those of you who like the simple things in life...CLOCK is foryou!Since CLOCK is a simple application, it is virtually bullet-proof.However, there is no expressed or implied warranty as to theperformance of the software.Argus Software EngineeringCompuServe: 73741,2415Internet: 73741.2415@compuserve.com
