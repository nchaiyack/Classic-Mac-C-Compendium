DEBUGIFY.DOC is formatted for a printer set to 66 lines per inchwith a fixed width font.  Printing to most dot matrix and daisy wheel printers isa cinch since this is the default format.  For instance a simple"copy DEBUGIFY.DOC PRN" would work under MS-DOS.  I believe thatsending this file directly to a Postscript printer would trigger a Diabloprinter emulation (or maybe that's only for Laserwriters?).  If you have an HPLaserJet, DeskJet, or compatible, set the printer to 66 lpi and 10cpi or 12 cpieither using the front panel or a software utility.
