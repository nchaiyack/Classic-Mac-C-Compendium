					MPW ICON DOCUMENTATION FILES
					============================

Several of the files on the distribution disk contain Icon documentation
and background information.  Some  are text  files and can be viewed and
printed by the MPW Shell.  The fonts in Word documents are optimized
for printing on the LaserWriter.

To print them on the ImageWriter, they will have the best quality if the
fonts Times 12 and  10, Helvetica  12,  and Courier 10 are installed (or
double  those sizes for  “best” quality printing).  Much of the style of
the  documents is  expressed through their fonts, so it  is  best not to
tamper with them unless absolutely necessary.
