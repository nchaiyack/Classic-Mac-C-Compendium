		MPW Icon  Version 9.0 Source Disks
		==================================

This is a small general information file for the Icon Programming
Language, Macintosh Programmer's Workshop version, source disks.

Most of the files are a compressed archive format.  Each of the ".sit"
archive files contain several compressed files.  The files were
compressed using the archiving utility program StuffIt.  A
decompress-only component of the Stuffit system, called UnStuffIt, is
included on this disk.

You will probably want to "unstuff" the documentation first, found in
the docs.sit archive.  The documentation contains further information on
extracting files and organizing the Icon hierarchy.

To run UnStuffIt:

1.  Double click the UnStuffIt icon.

2.  From the "File" menu, choose "Open Archive…".  Open the archive you
    wish to expand (for example, docs.sit).  UnStuffIt will open a window
    displaying the file names in the archive you opened.

3.  From the "Edit" menu, choose "Select All" to select all files for
    extraction (or click on individual files if you perfer to be
    selective).

4.  Click on the extract button near the bottom of the UnStuffIt window.

5.  UnStuffIt will present a "Save"-type dialog box so that you can
    specify the folder into which to place the extracted files, and even
    rename the file if you wish.  Normal operation at this point is to
    simply navigate to the folder where you want the files and click the
    "Save All" button, causing all files to be stored in the specified
    folder without further intervention.
