 * Jerry,

 * You're doing the snail shell the hard way.  Have you tried
 * shellgen? I've got a QBasic version for DOS (has a simple
 * graphics display), but there's a portable c version in the
 * dkb utilities package.  It uses a logarithmic spiral ala
 * Clifford Pickover to rotate spheres into a shell.
