                               POVSUDS                       Usage: POVSUDS output.incPOVSUDS is a variation of a program written by Sam Hobbs and published inthe Sept '91 C User's Journal.  The basic algorithm is from CliffordPickover's "Computers, Pattern, Chaos, and Beauty" (St. Martin's Press).I have added the ability to create Persistence of Vision Raytracer data filesusing redirection.  The file thusly created will consist of a union ofdeclared objects (SudsObject) that can be any object that youdesire (and have the CPU power to trace!) as long as the object has the samesize as a unit sphere (radius=1).  A file called SUDS.POV is included in thispackage.  This file is the "root" data file and it #includes the datagenerated by this program.  You must change the name of the #includefile to match that of the POVSUDS output file.Quickstart:-------------To use this program, type SUDS suds.inc and follow the prompts.  The first time through, I'd advise that you stick with the default values for everything.  This will create a file named "suds.inc" which is used by the included "suds.pov" file.  Then simply run POV-Ray with "POVRAY -Isuds.pov -Osuds.tga" (and any other switches you prefer).Going further:-------------The included "suds.pov" file has an object declared by the name of "SudsObject".  This is currently set up to use a single, simple sphere of radius 1.0.  You can use any other object in that declaration that you've got memory to render.  Simply replace the sphere definition with the object of your choice.There is only one texture currently defined in the suds.pov file (sudsTex1), although there are ten undefined textures already set up for you to edit.  If, when running SUDS, you select the option to use multiple textures, you will need to uncomment the definitions and add your desired textures to the declaration.Using with POV-Ray 1.0----------------------While the option exists for creating POV-Ray 1.0 files, it is highly recommended that you use POV-Ray 2.0 or newer.  Suds objects will render many times faster using the bounding slabs enhancements in POV-Ray 2.0.POV-Ray 1.0 users will also need to create their own suds.pov file.    - Dan Farmer        January 93        - Updated to POV-Ray 2.0 syntax.        - Dropped support for POV-Ray 0.5b        November 91        Updated November 93.  Has it really been that long?I have made the following changes:         o Changed to support new POV-Ray {} syntax         o Added registerVGA call to link with egavga.obj         o Made errors go to stderr         o Added 3D support (centers no longer constrained to a plane)         o Cleaned up input screen         o Added support for multiple textures         o Added spherical and rectangular bounding options         o Output to command line parameter         o Home the screen after <A>gain    - Tim Wegner        January 92
