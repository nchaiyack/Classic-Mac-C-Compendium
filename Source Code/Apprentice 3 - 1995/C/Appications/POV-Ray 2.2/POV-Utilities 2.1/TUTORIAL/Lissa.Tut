+-----------------------------------------------+|       POV-Utilities Macintosh Tutorial        ||                version 2.0                    ||           by Eduard [esp] Schwan              |+-----------------------------------------------+UTILITY:  Lissa==============1. WHAT IS IT?==============Lissa wraps a strand of spheres into a kind of basket-weavepattern.  You can specify the total number of spheres, thefactor/multiplier in the X, Y, and Z directions, the spheres'diameter, and a # of revolutions factor.  Lissa creates afile formatted for the CTDS utility.===================2. HOW DO I USE IT?===================--------------* Where is it?--------------Lissa is in the Utilities menu, under the sub-menu "SceneFile Creation".  It is called "'Lissa' Generator."----------------* The parameters----------------The parameters for Lissajous are:X Factor:Y Factor:Z Factor:  These factors determine how "fast" the spheres rotate  around each of the X,Y,Z axes.  To get the most interesting  patterns, it is best to use different values for each axis.  To get non-repeating paths, you should use prime numbers  for the factors.Total # of spheres:  This is the total number of spheres to use in the strands  that compose the whole Lissajous object.------------* The Output------------Lissa creates a file called Lissa.ctd.  This file is then usedas an input file for the CTDS utility.  CTDS will create asingle CTDS object from this file.-------------------------* Post-processing cleanup-------------------------You must first run Lissa's output file through the CTDSutility.  This will convert the .CTD input file to a POV-Ray.INC file.  Please see the tutorial on CTDS for moreinformation on this, CTDS.Tut.After creating the .inc file with CTDS, you will need tocreate a scene file that includes this Lissa.inc file, and hasa camera and light source.  You also need to specify thetextures that are given to the spheres and connecting cones inthe CTDS object.  To do this, you must declare the new texturesin your Lissa.pov scene file, just prior to including the.INC file, e.g.:  #declare LissaTut_CTDS_SphereTex  = texture {UtilTut_Texture}  #declare LissaTut_CTDS_ConeTex    = texture {UtilTut_Texture}  #include "LissaTut.inc"  object { LissaTut_CTDS_Obj }=============3. AN EXAMPLE=============-----------------------------* What we are going to create-----------------------------We want to create a Lissajous object that zigzags up and downa lot, and slowly marches around in the X and Z direction.We will leave it in its default orientation and unitsized (<-1,-1,-1> to <1,1,1>).-----------------------* What settings we need-----------------------Set the Factors to:  X:  7  Y: 17  Z:  3In order to get enough spheres in the object so that CTDSgives a fairly smooth tube for our example, we needto set the "# of points" to 200.To keep the strands fairly small so they don't overlapeachother, we will set the "Tube Diameter" to 0.05.We want a single full revolution, so set the "theta factor"to 1.0.Pick an output file called LissaTut.CTD, and save it in theTUTORIAL folder.  There is a LissaTut.POV file there waitingfor us.Click the OK button, and after a few seconds, the LissaTut.CTDfile will be created.------------------------------------------* What post-processing steps we need to do------------------------------------------We need to run the CTDS utility on this .CTD file, to createa POV-Ray file to use.  Run "Connect the Dots System" fromthe "Scene File Conversion" sub-menu.  Connect the beginningto the end, and for the input file, pick the newly createdLissaTut.CTD file in the TUTORIAL folder.We can now open the LissaTut.POV file in POV-Ray by simplydouble-clicking on LissaTut.POV from the Finder.  POV-Ray willopen it, and we should be ready to take a look at our newcreation.  First, look through the LissaTut.POV file to see howthe object is included and placed in the scene, and how the newtextures are applied to it.-----------------------------------------* How to incorporate it into a scene file-----------------------------------------You may want to become familiar with the default scene thatis set up in UtilTut.inc.  This file places the camera, createsa sky and floor, and illuminates the scene.  It assumes we arein the negative Z direction, looking at 0,0,0.  This is includedin each of the Tutorial .POV files.  All we need to do is putour object into the .POV file and render it.At the end of LissaTut.POV you will see how the object is putinto the scene.The textures of the sphere-joints and connecting rods must bedeclared before we include the .INC file, because the .INCfile refers to these textures as it defines each object.  Sofirst we declare the textures:  #declare LissaTut_CTDS_SphereTex  = texture {UtilTut_Texture}  #declare LissaTut_CTDS_ConeTex    = texture {UtilTut_Texture}Next, the include file we just created is included with thestatement:  #include "LissaTut.inc"This defines the object shape, but doesn't create an object yet.The object is declared on the next lines with:  object { LissaTut_CTDS_Obj }In POV-Ray, set the Rendering Options to 160x120, and renderthe image.  There it is!
