+==========================================================================| Macintosh POV-Ray| The Very Best FreeWare Macintosh Raytracer| Version 2.2, Feb. 10, 1994+--------------------------------------------------------------------------||   Questionaire - User Feedback|+--------------------------------------------------------------------------| Welcome to POV-Ray!  This application is a raytracer, a program that takes| a textual description of a 3-dimensional scene of objects, and creates a| full-color PICT image of the scene, with photo-realistic textures, shadows,| and reflections.  This program is FreeWare.  For more information on the| usage and distribution policies of POV-Ray, please see POVLEGAL.DOC.+==========================================================================Introduction-----------POV-Ray is in need of major changes on the Macintosh side, and I would like your feedback before I take any action that may leave any users behind.  After you have had a chance to play with POV-Ray and read the documentation (usually done in that order), please read the following questions below.  Answer each one, then mail your answers back to me (e-mail or US Mail.)  You don't need to include the questions with your responses, you may simply type your answers, referring to the question # to save space.  I will use your responses to prepare the next version of POV-Ray.  It is important for you to tell me how you are using POV-Ray, because if I don't hear from you, changes could be made to the program that may make it not run on your system next time around.  Or, you may be anxiously wanting some feature to be added... tell me so I can get it in.  Your feedback is loudly encouraged!+--------------------------------------------------------------------------| What is your current Hardware configuration...+--------------------------------------------------------------------------1. Macintosh Model   (Mac SE, II, PowerBook 170, Quadra 700, Centris 650, Power Macintosh, etc.)2. RAM memory   (4MB, 8MB, 20MB, etc.)3. Hard disk size & other storage   (80MB, 1.2GB, Syquest, CD-ROM, etc.)4. 32 bit addressing on?  Virtual Memory on?   (yes, no, what's that?)5. Video monitor configuration?   (number of monitors, sizes and depths?)6. Video card(s)?   (Apple, SuperMac, E-machines, etc.?)7. Accellerator cards installed?   (Daystar, Radius, Dove, etc.?)8. Are you connected to a network?   (LocalTalk, EtherTalk?)9. Other cards installed?+--------------------------------------------------------------------------| Your current Software configuration...+--------------------------------------------------------------------------10. System Software version?    (6.nn, 7.nn, A/UX, huh?)11. AppleScript installed?12. QuickTime version?   (none, 1.0, 1.5, 1.6.x, latest internal Apple Beta?)13. Roughly how many 3rd party inits/extensions?    (None, a few, lots, so many I never reboot?)14. Other notable software installed?    (After Dark, CAD modellers, other renderers?)+--------------------------------------------------------------------------| How do you get POV-Ray, updates and information...+--------------------------------------------------------------------------15. How did you get ahold of POV-Ray?     (BBS, CompuServe, Internet, Shareware disk, a friend?)16. Do you have access to on-line services & electronic mail?    Which ones? (Local BBS, CompuServe, Internet, GeNie, America On-Line,    AppleLink, etc.)+--------------------------------------------------------------------------| How do you use POV-Ray...+--------------------------------------------------------------------------17. What do you use POV-Ray for primarily?    (hobby, art, math, work, experimentation, etc.?)18. Can you characterize your typical scene usage?    (Usually math-related, lots of objects, a few objects,    use animation, large high-quality anti-aliased images,    lots of colors, lots of textures, lots of CSG, etc.)19. Do you use the Image window?  Do you use the x2, x3, & stretch features?    Do you use the Virtual Image Buffering due to memory constraints?20. Do you use the verbose progress options in the status window?21. Do you use the Targa options to continue partial traces?22. Do you use the Auto-save or Auto-shutdown features?23. Do you use the drag-n-drop multiple-file batch-render feature?+--------------------------------------------------------------------------| Feature comments...+--------------------------------------------------------------------------24. Do you/did you use POV-Ray's System 7 Balloon Help? Is it worth keeping?25. Do you/did you use the "Insert Templates" feature?    (should it stay, expand, shrink, change?)26. Should the templates become easy for users to edit themselves?    Maybe a simple text file instead of being built in to the program?    (If it was a text file, reading the file would be slow and take more    memory, so maybe a user-initiated "add in the templates now" menu    option could exist, so users could build the templates only if needed?)27. Should the templates presentation change from the current multi-level    sub-menu structure to maybe a multi list (topic/sub-topic) dialog?+--------------------------------------------------------------------------| Documentation comments...+--------------------------------------------------------------------------28. I never read documentation!29. Comments on the POVRAY.DOC?  Should it remain straight ASCII text,    or be in MacWrite, MS Word, T/Maker WriteNow?30. Comments on the Mac-specific readmes (Notes, ReadMe, this document?)31. Have you looked at the Waite Group's books on POV-Ray    ("Image Lab", "Ray Tracing Creations for the PC"?)+--------------------------------------------------------------------------| Archive comments...+--------------------------------------------------------------------------32. What do you think about the source code archive?  Do you look at the    source code?  Change it?  Not care?  Is the source code in a useful    format?33. What development environment and version do you use (MPW 3.x,    Symantec/Think 5 or 6.../Code Warrior?)34. Should the Mac archives remain self-extracting, or should they be    straight Compactor Pro <cpt.> or Stuffit (1.5.1 or 3.0) <.sit> archives,    making them somewhat smaller, but requiring that you have Compactor or    Stuffit to extract them?+--------------------------------------------------------------------------| What to do with the simple built-in Editor...+--------------------------------------------------------------------------35. It's OK, just add more features to it?  If so, which ones?    (find, replace, curly-brace matching, etc.?)36. Trash it, make POV-Ray a drag-n-drop rendering engine?    (I use BBEdit, MS Word, TeachText, etc.?)37. Is the hokey 32 KByte limit currently a problem?    (no prob, inconvenient, makes it useless?)38. Any other features/changes you'd like to see in the Editor?+--------------------------------------------------------------------------| What NEW features, directions and support would you like to see...+--------------------------------------------------------------------------39. Would the ability to drag out a selection in the image window and    re-render just that portion (at a different quality/anti-alias setting)    be useful?40. Do you want more information dynamically displayed, maybe in a new small    window or under the title of status window (memory used for image    versus scene, bounding info, stack depth, etc.?)41. I just want more primitives and textures!42. I want distributed network rendering so I can do fast parallel    rendering over the network (do you want smart real-time rendering,    or just some utilities to stitch together multiple partial images?)43. I want a Mac "CAD Modeller" front end, so I don't use up so much    graph paper, and I can whip out complex shapes faster!44. I want    (a) more frequent small updates to POV-Ray    (b) fewer but more substantial updates to POV-Ray    (c) no more updates, I can't keep up with all the changes!45. I want POV-Ray to be AppleEvent-aware, or AppleScript aware.  This    would allow easier batch operations, you could write command scripts    to render scenes at several sizes, auto-edit the scene between    renders, etc.46. I want you to strip all the System 6 code, and make it 7.x-only,    giving it more features and future compatibility, and even making    it run faster and be smaller.47. I need a (PowerPC, 68000, 68040, A/UX, non-FPU, etc.) specifically    tuned version of POV-Ray.48. I need extruded (3-D) TrueType fonts in POV-Ray.49. I need direct Mac PICT import in POV-Ray (currently image maps and    height-fields can only use GIF, POT, TGA formats.)50. How important are other POV-Ray-related utilities ported to the Mac,    things like snail-shell generators, DXF converters, Connect-The-Dots    (CTDS), benchmark scene generators, animation utilities, etc.?+--------------------------------------------------------------------------Again, please tell me what you would like to see happen, and I will useyour feedback to improve and change the course of Macintosh POV-Ray.Please contact me at:  Compuserve: 71513,2161  Internet: 71513.2161@compuserve.com  US Mail: 1112 Oceanic Drive, Encinitas, California, USA, 92024-4007ttfn,Eduard [esp] Schwan -- Mac Dude
