/*a quite simple algorithm and a main program to test it.Given two adjacent memory areas, swap them without losing theircontents. The two areas may be of different sizes. The thingis done in a single step and without using a large external buffer.(To do that in many steps is easy, but slow: repeatedly rotate thewhole data set by one until it reachs the required position. To dothat with a large buffer is easy, if enough memory is available: copyone of the areas to the buffer, move the other one to its final position,then copy the buffer to the final position of this data. But fulfillingboth the requirements is not easy).The algorithm is based on this fact: given two reciprocally primenumbers, then the succession:a(0)= any number between 0 and n2-1 (included)a(i+1)= (a(i)+n1) MOD n2visits once every number between 0 and n2-1 before repeating itself.Furthermore, one should remember that MCD(n1,n2) = MCD(n1,n1+n2)Now, do this:take away one byte and conserve it in a temporary place. Fill the"hole" in the data set by placing there the byte which must go therein the final (swapped) configuration, and continue in this way untilthe byte needed to fill the hole is the byte conserved outside thedata set.If dim1 and dim2 are reciprocally prime, this is enough to completethe job. Otherwise, this has put to the right place all the bytes whoseindex MOD MCD(dim1,dim2) is equal to the same expression computedfor the firstly chosen byte. So, simply repeat the job on bytes withdifferent values of that expression.The algorithm is simple enough that certainly somebody hasdiscovered and published it before I conceived it, but I don'tknow anything about that...Written by Gabriele Speranza, 11 July 1993*/#include <stdio.h>void visualizza(char*buf,int n);int euclide(int m, int n);void main(){char temp,buffer[1000];int i,j,new_i,dim1,dim2,MCD;for(;;){	for(i=0;i<sizeof(buffer);i++)		buffer[i]=i+' ';	printf("dim1, dim2:");	scanf("%d %d",&dim1,&dim2);	MCD=euclide(dim1,dim2);	visualizza(buffer,dim1+dim2);	for(j=0;j<MCD;j++){		temp=buffer[j];		i=j;		for(;;){			new_i= i+dim1;			if(new_i>=dim1+dim2) new_i=i-dim2;			if(new_i==j){				buffer[i]=temp;				break;				}			buffer[i]=buffer[new_i];			i=new_i;			}		}	visualizza(buffer,dim1+dim2);	}}static void visualizza(buf,n)char*buf;int n;{while(n--) printf("%c",*buf++);printf("\n");}static int euclide(m,n)int m,n;{int r;for(;;){	r=m % n;	if(r==0) return n;	m=n;	n=r;	}}
