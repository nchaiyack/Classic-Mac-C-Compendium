* place this file in the folder where suntar is, without* changing its name, and the character conversions defined* here will be performed  (I need not say that ASCII is not* a real standard and that codes beyond 127 mean different* things on different machines: you already know that...)* the syntax is very simple (and inflexible: no spaces around* the = ): all characters following a '*' are comments and are* ignored (obviously unless the * is just after the =) , but here* is the declaration of accented vowels for the Mac character set136=à 142=é 143=è 146=í 147=ì 151=ó 152=ò 156=ú 157=ù* (why translate Mac->Mac ?

With       * it, it's the opposite. That's because there is only one       * char table file and it's meaningless to apply it to both       * kinds of text* (really MS-DOS uses a number of different character sets, not only one !* that's just one of the innumerable sources of confusion in MS-DOS;* the previous characters are common to almost all sets)* Or if you have files using the ISO 8859/1 Latin 1 character set (some* UNIX machines use it, and Windows 3.1 uses it when it does not follow* the DOS encoding) here are the definitions to uncomment:* 131=ƒ 140=Œ 156=œ *Windows only* 161=¡ 162=¢ 163=£ 167=§ 169=© 170=ª 171=« 176=° 177=± 186=º* 187=» 191=¿ 192=À 195=Ã 196=Ä 197=Å 198=Æ 199=Ç 201=É 209=Ñ* 213=Õ 214=Ö 216=Ø 220=Ü 223=ß 224=à 225=á 226=â 227=ã 228=ä* 229=å 230=æ 231=ç 232=è 233=é 234=ê 235=ë 236=ì 237=í 238=î* 239=ï 241=ñ 242=ò 243=ó 244=ô 245=õ 246=ö 247=÷ 248=ø 249=ù* 250=ú 251=û 252=ü 255=ÿ* Note that everything not declared remains unchanged. Probably you* will have to configure this file in order to translate every character* that you use, but the way in which you do that depends on the* language you speak, the fonts you use and on your printer...* If you happen to use files coming from multiple sources, it's better* NOT to let suntar perform its conversions and convert later with* another application: in most cases a conversion can't be undone and* if it was the wrong conversion you've lost data (the Mac-Mac* conversion is not really a conversion and is not harmful, and that's* why it's the default).
