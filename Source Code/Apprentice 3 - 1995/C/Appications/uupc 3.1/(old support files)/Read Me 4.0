As requested here is my unofficial version of uupc.

The distribution is made in the form of a configured hierarchy, it
will run from this hierarchy from floppy or hard disk. To run from
floppy, you might like to copy and remove the sources in :usr:src.

You will need to change 2 files to configure this release
1) :usr:bin:profile
2) :usr:lib:uucp:config:systems

The profile file may be edited with resedit, it contains STR resources
that are used to override the defaults in the code. The profile comes set up
for username "user" and hostname "host". After changing the username you
will want to rename the folder :usr:home:user to reflect that change.
You will probably also want to edit the "signature" file in your new home
directory to remove the "smart-alec" message contained there (wonder if I'll
catch anyone!!). The fields within profile that you'll want to change are;
	NODENAME (put in the name of your machine - be inventive)
	MAILSERVICE (the name of the host that will be your backbone)
	HOME (the name of your home directory)
	DOMAIN (your nodename.uucp (probably))
	NAME (your full name for outgoing mail)
	MAILBOX (what you would like your mailbox to called)

the systems file is a text editable file that contains instructions
for uupc to login to the remote host that you will need to dial for
mail/file transfers etc. I have included some examples that you might
like to edit for your requirements (change the hostname, phone number,
login name etc.).

If you want to run uupc and/or pcmail from the LSC project
(say for debugging) be sure to copy the profile file into the same
folder as the project files since the application's home is the folder that
it is started from and profile will not be found otherwise.

CHANGES AND ENHANCEMENTS FOR v2.0 on LSC 4.0

Converted uupc and pcmail to LSC 4.0. Added prototype.h files to uupc
pcmail and unixlibrary (generated by prototypemaker). Set the "require
prototypes" option. Added "systems" (L.sys) \<number> option where
<number> is a decimal based number that changes the timeout from the
hokey standard to <number> seconds until the next \<number>. See systems
file in Support folder for an example. I've tried to enable all THINK_C
specific code using #ifdef THINK_C. I have not distinguished between
v3.0 and v4.0 so this is a 4.0 specific piece of code. The \<number>
mods are all #ifdef Upgrade, I'm not too proud of my code - my objective
was not to make substantive changes and I believe if I thought about it a bit
some of the additions are redundant. The \<number> directive is effective
when used in the send string preceeding the "expect" to which it applies.

Activated existing code for slave mode uucp, and tested it.

Modified BREAK send-string implentation to simulate BREAK by sending
extended sequences of NULLs at 300 baud (then resetting the baud-rate
back to original). I have not fully tested the effectiveness of this
technique - feedback is welcome. Use a send string of BREAK or BREAK<n>
where <n> is a single digit number (without the "<>") to send longer
BREAKs.

garym@crash added the blank/comment/continuation line capability
to the systems file - thanks gary.

I have broken apart the unixlib library and included the necessary source files
directly in the relevant projects. This was so that I could run the debugger
on library modules.

The pcmail front-end is not nice it did not deal with the \r seperated lines
that are generated by uupc transfers from unix machines (it does now). Pcmail
did not echo its input and had the wrong screen length for paging, these
problems are fixed. There is now a limited aliasing facilility within pcmail,
the file :usr:home:user:.alias (unless overidden by the profile STR:ALIAS)
may contain lines of the form;
alias A B
mail target A will be replaced by address B. Note this is a limited facility
only, although many addresses may be given in B (white space separated), no
aliasing of aliases is performed and the "To" field does not expand to contain
the actual recipients ("To: A" will result in the mail message though all
recipients in B will get a copy of the message (I hope!!)).

I have no other problems to report from this version of uupc. I can not
promise to support this distribution on anything other than an ad-hock
basis. No guarantee is implied and the software is provided "as is" (warts
and all).
