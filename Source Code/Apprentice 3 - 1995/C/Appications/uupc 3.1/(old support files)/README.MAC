mac 			June 8, 1987		Stuart LynneFor Beta implementors only.uupc incorporates a streamlined version of dcp to implement a uucp mailand news delivery system. See README.DCP for dcp info.See README.UU for overview of this version.This directory implements the macintosh version of host support routines. It runs under the Aztec Shell environment.By moving the host dependant code into one file the other four dcp files can hopefully be maintained easily. It should be possible to maintain one versionof them which compiles and runs on all machines without conditional compilationflags.To simplify things for other systems (Atari) use of -D in the cc command isnot used. Instead various small files are used to set flags and then includea common file.host.h 			- include <host/host.h>mailhost.c		- define MAIN mailmain; include <host/host.h>mlib.c			- include <host/mlib.c>ulib.c			- include <host/ulib.c>uuhost.c		- define MAIN mailmain; include <host/host.h>mac/host.c 		- generic macintosh host, calls MAINmac/host.h 		- macintosh host header filemac/mlib.c 		- mail librarymac/ulib.c 		- uupc librarymac/profile		- a sample aztec profile file to set environment varialbesThere is actually fairly little code here. I have a separate set of library routines for doing the standard things like directory support. See the shar file for the Macintosh library (maclib.shar).A separate uux command is included in uupc for the Macintosh (not finished yet).Called macbin it copies a MacBinary image from stdin to a Macintosh file.This allows macintosh files, including both forks and the finder info to bestored in a single file on the remote system. It can then be retrieved by:	uux macfile > remotemac!macbinA standalone macbin will be available to convert a Macintosh file into aflat file with the MacBinary image.For more information, bug fixes, more commands etc:		Stuart.Lynne@van-bc.uucp		604-937-7532PS. July 29/87See the Amiga version for a genv.c that gets environment var's froma profile file directly. I havn't had time to try on mac yet. I have made a VERY PRELIMINARY start at a standalone version, but havenot completed it yet. I hope to get more time to work on this earlyin the fall. In the meantime anyone who could get this running as a Macapplication.... please feel free. And send me the changes.sl
