August 9, 1987    uupc Questions and Answers     uupc Development


The following is some commonly asked questions about uupc and, of
course, the answers to these questions.


 1. What does "uupc" stands for?

    It is an acronym for "UUcp for PC's", but it is also a pun on
    uucp, which is in turn an acronym for "Unix to Unix CoPy".

 2. What does uupc do?

    It gives a personal computer the capability to become a
    "node" in the UUCP (or a similar) network and exchange
    information such as electronic mail and USENET news with
    other computers on that network.

 3. What personal computers does uupc runs on?

    Currently it is available for the Apple Macintosh, Atari ST,
    Commodore Amiga, and IBM PC (and compatibles) with DOS.  More
    computers and operating systems will be able run uupc in the
    near future.  (IBM PC with MINIX is a likely next candidate.)

 4. Does uupc require me to leave my computer on all day to wait
    for incoming mail?

    No.  Most people only use uupc to call up their neighbouring
    system to send and/or pickup mail at times convenient to
    them.  Outgoing mail are also spooled to disk and do not need
    to be send immediately to your neighbouring system after it
    is composed.

    However, uupc can also be set up on a personal computer to
    wait for incoming call continuously and act as a "mail-hub"
    to relay messages for other systems if you choose.

 5. What do I need to have to get uupc up and running on one of
    the above personal computers?

    You need a neighbouring system to communicate with.  This
    system can be either a UNIX system, another personal computer
    running uupc, or any other system that can talk UUCP's 'g'
    protocol.

    You would also need to have the appropriate C compiler for
    your personal computer if you have received only the source
    for uupc.

 6. Is the source to uupc publicly available?

    Yes.  It was posted to the USENET newsgroup comp.sources.misc
    in August 1987 and is available from (at least) any site
    which archives this newsgroup.  If you have trouble locating
    a copy of the uupc sources, please drop uupc Development a
    note through one of the e-mail addresses listed at the end of
    this file.

 7. What does the uupc software consists of?

    It consists of two programs, uupc and pcmail.  uupc is an automated
    files transfer program, similar to /usr/lib/uucico in UUCP,
    and mail is a mailer user-interface, like mail(1) in UNIX.

 8. What are the typical use of these programs?

    uu is used to accept incoming file relayed to you through
    your neighbouring machine and deliver outgoing file to your
    neighbouring machine for forwarding to other machines.  In
    most cases these "files" contain electronic messages which
    are to be used with the mail program.

    pcmail is used to read incoming mail delivered by uu, and
    compose outgoing mail for delivery with uu.  However, it can
    also be used to transfer files to/from other systems that is
    reachable through electronic mail.

 9. What do I need to do to get uupc running on my personal
    computer?

    You would need to obtain the binaries of uupc for your
    computer by either compiling the uupc sources on your machine
    or obtaining the uupc binaries from someone who has a copy.

    You would also need to arrange to have your neighbouring
    system to recognize your system as one of their neighbouring
    systems in the network.  The procedures for this varies, you
    should contact the people who manage your neighbouring system
    for about details.

10. Does uupc supports more than one neighbouring systems?

    Yes, it can support multiple neighbouring systems.  The mail
    software will currently always route outgoing mail through
    one of these systems, but a future version of this software
    will allow multiple forwarding machines for outgoing mail.

11. Is uupc the same program on all systems it runs on, or is it
    actually a different program for each of the systems?

    It is the same program across all systems, with the exception
    of the system-dependent code, which is different from system
    to system.

    The user-interface and command line options for uupc are also
    uniform across all the systems it runs on, so there is no
    need to learn a new program when you use uupc on a different
    computer.  The uniform user-interface also makes it easier to
    use uupc on different computers at the same time.

12. If I don't like the mail program's simple user-interface, are
    there any alternatives?

    Since a mailbox can be easily converted to a simple text
    file, alternative mailer can be easily written to accomodate
    different needs.  At the very least, you will be able to use
    your favorite text-editor to read your incoming message and
    compose your outgoing message.

    Future release of uupc will include mailers for the different
    systems which will take advantage of special features only
    availabe on the systems they run on (e.g. window and mouse).

13. What if I want to port uupc to another personal computer not
    presently support by uupc?

    First you should read the file UUPORT.INF, which should be
    available from the same source you obtained this file from.
    If you cannot locate a copy of this file, then please send a
    request for it to uucp Development at one of the e-mail
    addresses listed at the end of this file.

    After you have read the above file and decided that you still
    want to do a port of uupc to a new machine/operating systems,
    please drop uupc Development a note at one of the the e-mail
    addresses listed at the end of this file.  This way we will
    at least be able to save each other from duplicated efforts.
    Who knows?  We might even have a version for ready for your
    system when you call to tell us that you are about to begin
    your port.

16. If I have more questions, comments, or suggestions about
    uupc, where should I send them?

    Please send them all to us at uupc Development at one of the
    e-mail addresses listed below.  We also welcome any bug fixes
    and improved/new code for uupc that you might want to share.


uupc Development can be reached at the following e-mail address:

	uupc@van-bc.UUCP

This is routed to the uupc mailing list and a local news group for 
discussion of uupc software.

To join the mailing list send a request to:

	uupc-request@van-bvc.uucp



17. Can I get Binary Versions of uupc mailed to me.

Yes and no. 

No we cannot email binaries to you at this time.

Yes, if you send a self addressed / stamped (international coupon) mailer
with appropriate diskettes (2) we will attempt to return them to you with
the appropriate version of the software.

We plan to make a binary posting to the appropriate Usenet comp.binary
newsgroups in the late fall, or early next year when the software is 
a bit more functional, better documented and easier to install and
operate without the source.

Mail your disks to:

	UUPC Request
