NewGabi481===========This is a little D&D that takes a text file (named *.txt) with figures as inputand calculates two diagrams. These diagrams are then written to a picture file(named *.txt.pict) that can be viewed, printed and edited with almost any programcapable of reading PICTs (and, ehm, yes, this is exactly the thing you need forpenciling!).DRAWBACKS:============- In it«s present form, the program will not be of much use to anyone but my wife  Gabi, but I think it is fairly easy to rewrite and customize the program.   Therefore, it«s only purpose is to demonstrate some (very) basic techniques used   to draw images and to handle files.- A limit on the number of files that can be dragged simultaneously.- Since we are both satisfied with what the program does right now, it is very  unlikely that I am going to improve it in any direction :-)  COPYRIGHT NOTICES:==================NewGabi481 and the included sources and libraries are copyright ©1995 AndreasAmoroso (parts are copyright Symantec).
