This directory contains a few small Perl scripts for the Mac:

	4112Balloon converts the PerlHelp file from 411 format into the format used by
		MacPerl help.

	DirMenu sets up the Directory menu the way I do it on my home system. It is
		unlikely that you would want to use this script directly, but it
		demonstrates the interaction between the MPW Shell and Perl. (Tool)
	
	find2perl is a script emulating the Unix find program, adapted for MPW by
		Charlie Reiman. (Tool)
	
	h2ph is a script converting a C header to Perl declarations. (Tool)
	
	sendps send a PostScript query to the currently connected printer. 
		
If you have written neat Perl scripts that you would like to share with the world,
mail them to me.
