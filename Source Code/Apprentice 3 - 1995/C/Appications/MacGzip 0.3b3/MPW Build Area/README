How to build
------------
	Create a folder named obj in this directory (if not already there).
	Set this directory as the current directory and choose Build from
	the Build menu. Answer all to Program Name? dialog. Take a break,
	this is not CodeWarrior.


NOTE
----
	MPW build of MacGzip has only been tested with ETO #16 Prerelease MPW. The
	universal interfaces are constantly changing, so it might be necessary to
	fix a few things if using another version of MPW.

Thanks to SPDSoft for doing the hard part. Any errors in this version
are all mine.
