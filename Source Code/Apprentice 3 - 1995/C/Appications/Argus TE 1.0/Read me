Argus Text Editor 1.0
written by Mark Butkiewicz

Why do you need another text editor.  Well, you don't.  TE was
developed solely as an exercise to learn how to use the Toolbox
routines in the Text Edit Manager.

Although you can feel free to use this application and function 
libraries as you wish, there is no expressed or implied warranty 
as to the performance of the software.
