ÊÊ¥	Thank you for showing an interest in Creator Changer 2.0!¥	Creator Changer will allow you to change what documents belong to what applications, as well as what the document type is.Ê¥	You must have System 7.0 or later and 50 k of free RAM to run Creator Changer 2.0.¥	To change a file(s) type(s):First you must tell Creator Changer which file(s) you want to change.  There are three different ways to do this.				Method 1:Drag the file(s) you wish to change onto the Creator Changer icon.				Method 2:Double Click on the Creator Changer icon.  You will be presented with an open dialog.  From here you can select a file to change.				Method 3:If Creator Changer is already open, you can choose 'Open...' from the 'Options' menu.  You will be presented with a standard open dialog box.  From here you can choose the file which you would like to change.Once you have chosen which file(s) to edit you can give it (or them) a new type:Either type in the new file type and creator and press the 'Ok' button. 										OR	Choose the type from the popup menu in the lower left corner of the dialog and press the 'Ok' button. 										OR	Press the 'Make Like...' button.  You will be presented with an open box, which  will allow you to choose a file to use as a template for the current file.  This is useful if you don't know what to set the Creator or Type to, but know what kind of file you want to make.  Press 'Ok' to change the current file.¥	To edit the pop-up menu:Choose 'Edit Types List...' from the 'Options' menu.When the dialog comes up, you can add a file type by filling in the three text boxes and pressing the 'Add' button.To remove a file type, choose it from the pop-menu and when its name appears in the menu, press the 'Delete' button. You can also add a type by choosing 'Get File...'.  You will be presented with an open box, which will allow you to choose a file of the same type that you wish to add to the menu.  This is useful if you don't know that the Creator or Type is.¥	Other things to know about Creator Changer 2.0.¥	'Creator Changer 2.0' is also totally controlable from the keyboard.  In the dialog boxes, typing the  key and the first letter of the button, is the same as pressing that button with the mouse.  To activate the default buttons (those with the double, heavy black border) just press the return key.Ê¥	The author assumes no responsibility for direct, indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages resulting from any errors contained in the manuals or in the program, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.Ê¥	I am a student at the University of Connecticut.  I am seeking a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering/Metallurgy.  My expected time of graduation is in the Spring of 1997.  ¥	I wrote "Creator Changer" using Symatec's THINK C 7.0.4 on a Performa 637CD 20/350.Ê¥	I have made the following changes since version 1.0:				+	Added the prefered types list pop-up menu in the change dialogs.				+	Added the Edit Types dialog.				+	Added support for the core AppleEvents (Drag and Drop included).				+	An immense amount of internal coding re-working.				+	Better memory management (if that is what you want to call it).¥	These are my plans for future versions (maybe):				+	The icon in the 'Change Dialog' will display the 'Current' files icon.				+	More Areodynamic  code.				+	Support for dragging folders.				+	3D buttons, but it adds another 25k to the memory partition.¥	This program is mailware.  I only ask that you mail me and tell me what you think of it.¥	If you upload it to other archives, please include all of the following folders and files:				+	Creator Changer 2.0				+	Read me				+	Code and Resource  (folder)Doing this will greatly improve the chances of me getting good feed back about the program.  If anyone has plans to bundle Creator Changer with a software pakage (via CD's, books, etc.) I just require that you inform me and send me that pakage free of charge.  I can be reached at:		E-Mail:	    cwasko@aol.com  Snail-Mail: Christopher Lee Waskowich              7 Clark Place              Quaker Hill, CT 06375-1205¥	Special thanks to the following people/companies:+	My father, for putting up with me abusing  his Performa 637CD while I didn't have a computer.+	Shawn Pearce, for giving me usefull programming related information over the net and for giving me the idea of the 'Make Like...' and 'Get File...' buttons.+	Celestin Company, makers of the Apprentice CD; for one: putting version 1 of Creator Changer on the CD, and two: shipping me the CD.
