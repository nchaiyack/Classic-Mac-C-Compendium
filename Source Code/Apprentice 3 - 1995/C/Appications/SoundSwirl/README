SoundSwirl is a small application that generates geometric
shapes around the mouse pointer.  The shape's size corresponds
to the current sound level of the built-in microphone.  Thus,
you must have sound-input hardware to use this program. Ported
to CodeWarrior 6 by Paul Celestin from the original project by
Brent Burton.
