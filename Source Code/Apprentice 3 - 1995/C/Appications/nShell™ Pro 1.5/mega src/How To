This package provides additional source code for the nShellª environment.  It is assumed that you have installed the nShell application and its Programmer's Guide.  These packages are available from a number of on-line sources.These files have been designed to build with either the Think C or the CodeWarrior development environments.  Project files are included for Think C only.  Tech Note 1, included in with the Programmer's Guide, describes how to create CodeWarrior project files for nShell commands.Think C Development Environment===============================The folder called "Source" contains source code for nShell commands.  For each command there are three files:something.¹      - A Think C project filesomething.c      - Source code for the commandsomething.¹.rsrc - Resources for the commandIf you wish to build one of these commands, copy the latest "lib" folder and that command's files to your nShell development folder.To Build A Command Using Think C================================1. Start up Think C (version 5.0 or later)2. Open the project file3. Select "Build Code Resource" from the "Project Menu".4. Give the command a unique name and select "Save" to store the command.5. Drop the new command into your "bin" directory.
