This package provides source code for the nShell-Proª application.

These files have been designed to build with Think C v5.  Project files are included for Think C only.

The only real trick is that the file "nsh.h" contains two important defines:

#define PROFESSIONAL	  1   // set to 1 to allow flow commands
#define FULL_APP       1   // set to 0 to build drag 'n drop app

It is important that the PROFESSIONAL flag be on (to allow Pro features).  The second flag, FULL_APP is used to turn on or off features when the nShell Droplet is built. It is vital that the FULL_APP flag be 1 when you build the application and be 0 when you build the Droplet.

To Build The nShell Using Think C
=================================

1. Start up Think C (version 5.0 or later).

2. Open the project file (for the nShell or the nShell Droplet).

3. Select "Build Application" from the "Project Menu".

4. Give the command a unique name and select "Save" to store the command.

5. Drop the new command into your "bin" directory.

Good Luck, and thank you for your support.
