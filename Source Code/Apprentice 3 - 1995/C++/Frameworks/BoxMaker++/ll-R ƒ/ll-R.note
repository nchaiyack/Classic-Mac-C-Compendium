Version history:941201: 1.0 For publication with Apprentice, release 2950110: 1.1 Using dropshell 1.1, added 'CouldNotEnterFolder' virtual member.		=> no longer balks on AppleShare folders without read access950525: 1.2 dropshell renamed to BoxMaker++, using BoxMaker++ 1.2,		added option to output sizes in bytes		Fixed bug: type was output when creator was requested and vice versa950614:	1.3 using BoxMaker++ 1.3950622: 1.3.1 built using BoxMaker++ 1.3.1Known bugs:- no error checking during file creation. Name collisions are improbable,  but one should check for them, anyway. Write protected disks are also  improbable, but disk full errors might occur.Known limitations:- when processing lots of files, it would be nice if WaitNextEvent were  called from time to time. => use the thread manager, and maintain a list  of aliases to process. 'This is kept as an exercise for the reader'  950420: This is partly fixed as per BoxMaker 1.1. It does call WaitNextEvent  periodically during a recursive descent.
