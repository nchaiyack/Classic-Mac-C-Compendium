What it is:µZak is a utility for playing the sound tracks of QuickTimeª Movies. Just drag the icon of some QuickTime movies, some folders containing QuickTime movies, or even the icon of your hard-disk on µZak, and enjoy the music. Preferences settings are pretty self-explanatory. One thing to look out for is the Cancel current button. It removes the currently playing file from the queue, even if Requeue files after playing is checked.Preferences are saved automatically when the program is quit.µZak Collection Starter is an AppleScript which can be used to start µZak with your favourite set of movie files. To configure it drop a set of files and/or folders on µZak Collection Starter. When µZak Collection Starter is later run (by double-clicking the AppleScript) it asks µZak to open these items. µZak Collection Starter can even be put in the Startup Items folder, thus providing you with an automatic jukebox. µZak Collection Starter requires AppleScript. If you want to store different sets of movies simply make as many copies of µZak Collection Starter as you need.Disclaimer:If it works, it works; if it doesn't, it doesn't. If it does what you think it does, you're happy; if it doesn't, don't blame me. It is free, and worth every penny.What it needs:Obviously, µZak needs QuickTimeª. To play MIDI files, you need QuickTimeª 2.0 and the QuickTime Musical Instruments file. Also, µZak uses AppleEvents, so it needs System 7.How to get the source:µZak is an example dropbox built with BoxMaker++, a C++ shell for the creation of System 7 compatible dropboxes. BoxMaker++ should be available on the net. The distribution of BoxMaker++ 1.3.1 contains the complete source code for µZak (Symantec C++ 8.0, with Universal Headers).Reporting bug fixes or bugs:If you find a bug, it would be really nice if you obtained the source, and sent me both a bug report and its fix. Reporting bugs without giving a fix is also allowed. Even if you do report a fix, however, I don't promise to distribute an improved version.Fat version:Currently I don't own a PowerMac or a compiler which can produce PowerMac binaries. Therefore, if you want to have a PowerMac native version you have to compile it yourself, using the source code, as it is included in the BoxMaker++ 1.3.1 distribution. I would be grateful if you sent me a copy, so I can include it in the distribution (of course, you also can send me a PowerMac and a compiler; I would be willing to build a fat version for you then) The lack of a fat version is not a major problem, though. The program spends the majority of its time inside QuickTime, and whether that is fat is not something I can influence.Distribution policy:µZak may be freely used and distributed, as long as it is not modified and this file is distributed with it in unmodified form.Version history:9412??: 1.0 for personal use only950115: 1.1 released with BoxMaker++ 1.1, also released separately950525: 1.2 released with BoxMaker++ 1.2, also released separately                 Added ÔShuffleÕ and ÔVolumeÕ controls950614: 1.3 released with BoxMaker 1.3, also released separately                 Allows selection of folders in ÔOpenÉÕ Dialog box950622: 1.3.1 Works around a bug in ApplWindows 2.0.2, which causes 1.3 to crash at exit.                 built with BoxMaker++ 1.3.1Reinder Verlinde (reinder@neuretp.biol.ruu.nl)
