Known bugs:- error handling is poor, especially during the opening of movies.- some older sound medias have mediatypes of zero (as opposed to SoundMediaType)  These movies are not played since a mediatype of zero does not have to signal  a sound media (or should that be 'a sound medium'?)- should figure out how much memory the application really needs. It appears that  QuickTime grabs most of the memory from somewhere else than the application heap,  so µZak runs fine in about 100K. I don't know whether this is generally true, though.- Randomize does not work as expected (when launching with multiple files the first  random one may get selected after only one has been added to the queue. Thus, the  first file selected is not really a random one).Version history:950525	1.2, Added 'volume' and 'Randomize' options to dialog950614	1.3, using BoxMaker++ 1.3, some bug fixes in volume pop-up950622	1.3.1 using BoxMaker++ 1.3.1, which contains a fix to make		µZak no longer crash when ApplWindows 2.0.2 is installed
