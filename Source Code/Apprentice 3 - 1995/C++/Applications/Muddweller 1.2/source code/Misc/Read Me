MUDDweller 1.2==============MUDDweller 1.2 is a MUD client for the Macintosh. MUDs (Multi User Dungeon/Dimension) are multi-user games, usually running on UNIX machines and accessed through the internet. This program allows you to connect to a MUD, either with the communication toolbox or with MacTCP. It works roughly like a terminal emulator, but is line- oriented and offers additional functionality. Of course, it might also be possible to use this program for other types of line-oriented communication.MUDDweller supports multiple sessions, connections with either the communication toolbox or with MacTCP, a command history and simple file transfer mechanisms. In version 1.2, the main window is now resizable and supports more than 32K of word-wrapped text in an arbitrary font and size. This version also adds support for logging a session to a file and for simple macros. Macros can be used to automate the login / logout process or to perform a fixed set of operations when a key is pressed.This program was developed for my personal use with LPmuds, but it may also be useful in conjunction with other types of MUDs. If you find bugs you can can send me mail at one of the following addresses:maquelin@cs.mcgill.ca (new address, not sure if it works)maquelin@tik.ethz.ch (old address, but should still work)As you can see from these mail addresses, I am moving to a different university. This means that I will probably not be able to further enhance this program in the future. For that reason, MUDDweller is now in the public domain. Feel free to do whatever you want with it.-- Olivier
