Hi,

The only file which I know is missing from this source is the "HyperCuber 
TCLHeaders++" file.  This is a precompiled version of the Think Class 
Libary 2.0 headers, using HyperCuber's compiler settings.  I didn't 
include it because it's 1.6 Meg and you can make on with little hassle.
Here's how:

  1.  Open HyperCuber.pi  (the project file)
  2.  Open "TCL #includes.cpp".  It's in the Think Class Library 2.0
      folder, in the "Symantec C++ for Macintosh" folder.
  3.  Choose "Precompile..." from the Source menu.
  4.  Save the precompiled header file as "HyperCuber TCLHeaders++" in the
      HyperCuber source code directory.

That's it!
