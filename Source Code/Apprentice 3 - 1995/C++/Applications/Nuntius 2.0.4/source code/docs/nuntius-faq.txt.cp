NUNTIUS INSTALLATION QUESTIONS---------------------------------(A.1)   Where can I get Nuntius?        Peter Speck (speck@ruc.dk), the author of Nuntius, puts all        his versions and sources at the anonymous ftp site        "ftp.ruc.dk".        ftp://ftp.ruc.dk/pub/nuntius/        I've set up a WWW page suitable for use with Mosaic, MacWeb,        Netscape, etc.  You can find it here:        http://guru.med.cornell.edu/~aaron/nuntius/nuntius.html        Peter also regularly uploads Nuntius to the archives at        sumex-aim, etc.(A.2)   What is the current version of Nuntius?        At this time, the current release version is 2.0  It is        distributed as a "fat binary," and will run on both 68k and        Power Macs.        The information is this FAQ pertains to version 2.0 and may        not be relevant to previous versions.(A.3)   What does Nuntius need to run?        Nuntius requires System 7, at least 5 Mb RAM, and a Mac with        Internet access.  "Internet access" means that you need MacTCP        (version 2.0.6 is recommended), and a network connection, such        as Ethernet, SLIP or PPP.(A.4)   What else does Nuntius need to run on the PowerPC?        If you have a Power Macintosh, you will also need Apple's        Thread Manager and AppleScript installed.        The Thread Manager is available from Apple as:        ftp://ftp.austin.apple.com/Apple.Support.Area/              Apple.Software.Updates/Supplemental.System.SW/              Thread.Manager.2.0.1/        AppleScript should have come with your PowerMac, but you'll        need to install it yourself.  The installer is in the "Apple        Extras" folder.  If you don't have AppleScript ,then you'll        need to purchase it.  But you would probably be better off        purchasing System 7.5.        Risto Virtanen (rvirta@utu.fi) notes that AppleScript is        included in the book "The Tao of AppleScript," published by        Hayden Books.        Both of these extensions are included in System 7.5.(A.5)   Is there documentation for Nuntius?        Nuntius users are currently banding together and writing        a user's guide.        Mike Kuniavsky (mikek@umich.edu) has made available some        University of Michigan documentation on Nuntius.  Ftp to "        ftp.css.itd.umich.edu", and look in "/users/mikek" for        "new-nuntius.word5.hqx" and "new-nuntius.rtf" for Binhexed        Mac Word 5 and RTF files.        ftp://ftp.css.itd.umich.edu/users/mikek/        There's also Cornell University documentation (originally        written by me :-) on a WWW (Mosaic) page here:        http://guru.med.cornell.edu/~aaron/nuntius/nuntius.html        This FAQ is also on that page.(A.6)   What does "ppc", "68k", "fat", "sea", "hqx", and "src" mean?        ppc = PowerPC        68k = Older, non-PowerPC Mac (68000 - 68040 model CPUs)        fat = A program written for BOTH PowerPC and 68k Macs.        sea = Self-Extracting Archive        hqx = BinHex (binary encoded to text)        src = Source code        The first group of acronyms tell which Macintosh computers        the software was designed for.  Both "68k" and "fat" programs        will work with any Macintosh computer.  Both "fat" and "ppc"        programs are optimized to run on the processor inside a Power        Macintosh computer, the PowerPC.  If a file is missing one of        these designations, it is probably "68k".        The second group of acronyms tells how a Macintosh file has        been encoded to be stored on an ftp server.  Usually, files        are both compressed and BinHexed.        Only programmers will want to look at the source code for        Nuntius.B. GENERAL NUNTIUS QUESTIONS----------------------------(B.1)   What does "Nuntius" mean?        According to Erik Reuter (e-reuter@uiuc.edu), "`Nuntius' is a        Latin noun which translates to `messenger'."  He suggests that        it is pronounced nun-tee-uss (not noon-tee-uss).  "But if you        ask someone familiar with `Church Latin' you may get a        different answer."        Saul Kondrotas (kondrotass@RFERL.ORG) adds, "I had had some        Latin back in my university years. To the best of my knowledge,        'Nuntius' translates into 'emissary'. The word is still in use:        that's how the Vatican's ambassadors are called. In Latin you        say it 'noon-TSee-uss'."(B.2)   What does "threaded" mean?        It means two things.  In the context of newsreaders, threaded        means that Nuntius arranges articles by subject within a        newsgroup.  See answer (C.1), below, for more information.        In the context of a Macintosh application, it means Nuntius can        perform simultaneous tasks, such as checking for new articles,        extracting and uudecoding a binary file, and fetching an        article from the server to read.  Each task is called a thread.        The "Thread Manager" is an extension from Apple which helps        applications manage these tasks.  It is available from Apple        (see answer (A.4), above).  The current version is 2.0.1.        Nuntius can do threading just fine WITHOUT the Thread Manager.        However, some users have reported the Thread Manager to be a        bit more stable, and perhaps faster.(B.3)   What's the difference between "Nuntius Personal Files" and        "Nuntius Public Files"?        From John T. Chapman (jtc1@cornell.edu):       "These folders store information on the various groups and        articles.  The Personal Folder contains information on what        articles _you_ have read.  The Public Folder contains article        subjects, etc.       "From what I've seen, you can delete all newsgroup items from        the Public Folder. Nuntius will need to rebuild all of these        the next time it opens those groups and will thus be slower.        However, I've seen large amounts of space reclaimed (more than        a meg). This is probably due to some inefficiency in the way        Nuntius updates these files; the full rebuild causes some        'housecleaning'.  Deleting items from the Personal Folder will        result in you losing track of what items you have marked as        read.       "Supposedly, one or both folders can be Aliased to someplace        outside the System Folder (a server volume?)       "There is also the 'dummy file' trick from the Nuntius Notes        file - replace the 'Nuntius personal folder' with a dummy file        and Nuntius will only open when a Nuntius Preferences file is        double-clicked on. This helps administrators configure Macs        that will be used by several people (e.g. public labs)."        Peter Speck (speck@ruc.dk) also notes:       "The 'dummy file' trick used for the personal files can [also] be        used with the public files.  The effect is: Nuntius doesn't save        its database (but operates otherwise normal).  This will save you        diskspace, but opening large groups will be slower.(B.4)   How can I configure Nuntius to work in a public lab?        The short answer is that you make users launch Nuntius from a        "Nuntius Preferences" file, and not from the Nuntius        application.        You should make copies of the "Nuntius Personal Files" folder        from the Preferences folder.  You may put this folder elsewhere        on that hard drive, on a floppy, or on a server.  Inside each        copy will be a separate "Nuntius Preferences" folder.        For example, I'm going to copy the "Nuntius Personal Files"        folder and rename it "Aaron's News".        If you launch Nuntius by double-clicking on a "Nuntius        Preferences" file, it will use the copied folder as a        replacement for the standard "Nuntius Personal Files" folder in        the Preferences Folder.        In the example, I'll launch Nuntius by opening up "Aaron's        News", and double-clicking on "Nuntius Preferences".  Nuntius        will then associate my preferences and articles with my folder,        which I may move from Mac to Mac.        To *force* users to open Nuntius this way, create a FILE called        "Nuntius Personal Files" in the Preferences folder.  If you        try to launch Nuntius by double-clicking on the application        (the normal way), Nuntius will politely explain that the        administrator of this Macintosh wishes you to launch from a        preferences file.(B.5)   Where are the group descriptions that Nuntius claims to fetch?        Turn on Balloon Help and look in the List of All Groups.        Pretty cool, huh?  Unfortunately, this doesn't work in saved        group lists.(B.6)   How do I change my news server?        That information is stuck inside the Nuntius Preferences        document.  You will need to trash that document, and reset all        your preferences.(B.7)   Where is a PUBLIC news (NNTP) server?        From Dr. Chaos:       "Arnold Lesikar has produced a compilation of publicly        addressable news sources, annotated with comments like whether        or not they allow posting, etc.  Before you get too excited and        go looking for a site carrying alt.binaries.pictures.erotica,        forget it ... the administrators at these sites know that their        systems are going to be on the list, so it's unlikely this list        will provide you with that kind of source.  You can get the        latest version of the list from nctuccca.edu.tw (Taiwan)        located in Lesikar.NNTP-Servers in the        documents/Internet/MaasInfo/Other directory.  Alternatively,        'finger lesikar@tigger.stcloud.msus.edu'.  Included in the file        are the Gopher bookmark entries to access these sites."(B.8)   Can Nuntius decode ROT-13?        Yes, beginning with version 1.2.  Press Command-D when reading        a message.(B.9)   What's the difference between "SAVE", "SAVE AS", and "SAVE A        COPY AS"?        SAVE is the easiest way to save; it simply updates the disk        file with the same name as the title.        SAVE AS... allows me to change the name of the document.  For        example, I may save as "Aaron's Other Groups".  The window's        title will change to "Aaron's Other Groups".  The file        "Aaron's Groups" will still be on the disk, but it may contain        older information.        SAVE A COPY AS... does just that.  If the current title is        "Aaron's Groups", and I save a copy as "Aaron's Other Groups",        then the window title will remain "Aaron's Groups" (but there        will be an "Aaron's Other Groups" file on the disk, as well as        "Aaron's Groups").  If I then SAVE, the "Aaron's Groups" file        will be updated (not "Other").        Or, as Kevin Boyce (boyce@lheavx.gsfc.nasa.gov) says, "Gawrsh,        it's just the same as in any other program, why was I so        confused?"(B.10)  How can I select multiple articles for binary extraction?        Hold down the Shift key if the parts are next to each other,        or the Command key if they are not.        These are actually standard keys for extending a selection,        but they are not very well known.(B.11)  How do I avoid the quotation marks and attribution when        copying article text?        When choosing "Copy" from the Edit menu, the Shift key        will leave off the attribution ("In article xxx, yyy wrote:"),        and the Option key will leave off the quotation marks (">").        The same modifiers work with the "Follow-up" and "Reply by        mail" commands.        There is no way in Nuntius to select less than a full line        at a time.(B.12)  Can Nuntius show the date, or search for text? or have a        built-in editor? or a built-in mailer? or support for        cross-posted articles? or support XOVER?        No.  But the source code (in C++ & MacApp) is available (see        A.1, above).  You are free to add it yourself.C. ARTICLE SORTING & POSTING QUESTIONS--------------------------------------(C.1)   How does Nuntius sort articles?        Nuntius is a "threaded" news reader.  In this context, threaded        means that it sorts articles into threads.        OK, wiseguy, so what's a thread?  A thread is an article and        all the followups (responses or modifications) to it.  A simple        example of a thread is an article with the question "What's the        sum of 2 and 2?", and a followup, "Re: What's the sum of 2 and        2?".        Standard news practice says that followups be designated in two        ways.  (1) the phrase "Re:", meaning "regarding" or "response        to" is placed in the subject of the followup.  Therefore, the        followup to "XYZ" is "Re: XYZ".  (2) A "References:" header is        added to the followup with a reference to its original (parent)        article.  Not every newsreader uses both methods (Nuntius        does).        Nuntius sorts by grouping articles which share references.  It        ALSO displays the threads alphabetically, so that articles        with like subjects which DON'T have proper "Reference:" headers        are next to each other.(C.2)   How come some follow-up's don't end up in the same thread?        Some newsreaders do not put the reference header in a followup.        Nuntius therefore thinks that this is a new post (regardless of        it's subject), and places it in a new thread.        Newswatcher, for example, sorts by subject.  This is not        necessarily a better way, but a different way.  Ideally,        perhaps, both methods could be used.        (Recent versions of Nuntius sort newsgroups alphabetically,        so even "damaged" threads usually end up next to each other.)(C.3)   What do NEW, UNREAD, and UPDATED TODAY mean?        NEW articles have been fetched from the server since the last        time I opened the newsgroup.  They are marked with a bullet        (Black Dot, option-8).        UNREAD articles have not yet been read by me.  That is, I may        have opened the newsgroup (read the subjects), but I have not        opened the thread containing the article (not read the        article).  NEW articles are a subset of UNREAD articles.        UNREAD articles which are not NEW are marked with a dash.        UPDATED TODAY articles have been fetched from the server today.        They may contain NEW, UNREAD and/or READ articles.  There is no        special marking for these articles.        For example, I open comp.sys.ibm.pc.misc, a group I have never        before opened, and all of the articles are marked with a bullet        (NEW).  I read a few of the articles, then close the group.        The next day, I open the group again.  Now, the articles which        have been posted since yesterday have a bullet (NEW).  The        articles which are older, but which I didn't read yesterday,        are marked with a dash (UNREAD, but not NEW).  And the articles        which I have read have no mark.(C.4)   How do I know whether posting works?        Post to a test group, such as "misc.test".  You should see the        message you posted there within a few minutes.  You may have to        open and close the group again.        Watching misc.test, in particular, are a number of automatic        responders which send you mail when they see your message.        Using these, you can find out is your posts are getting out to        the world.(C.5)   How come I can't see the article I just posted?        Nuntius only checks for new articles when you open a group, so        you may have to close and re-open the window.        Also, not every news server shows articles immediately.        Cornell's Sparc 10 running INN shows a posted article within        about 15 seconds, but I had to wait half a day when I used a        VAX running a poorly configured VMSNEWS.(C.6)   How come "Post Followup" or "Reply to author by mail" is        disabled?        You need to highlight some text in the original article.  This        is because Nuntius can display many articles at once; you need        to tell Nuntius WHICH article you want to followup or reply        to.(C.7)   How to I crosspost to multiple newsgroups?        Type in the newsgroup names separated by a comma, with no        spaces.  This is the specification for news.  Someday, Nuntius        will be smarter.D. COMMON NUNTIUS PROBLEMS--------------------------(D.1)   I can't "Quit"!!!        Or, "My "Quit" menu choice is grayed-out!  This is one that        people occasionally see, but that Peter hasn't been able to        figure out yet.  He has, however, hacked in "fix".  If you hold        down the Control key when you click in the menu bar, "Quit"        should be enabled.        Also try to "click twice" on the menu bar.  Peter says, "That's        just how MacApp is."(D.2)   Does it work properly under A/UX?        Nuntius used to have problems with replying and posting under        A/UX.  One of two problems (colons in filenames) has been fixed.        The other problem (a hack for Eudora) has been "solved" with        AppleScript.        So now the question is, does AppleScript work with A/UX?  I        don't know the answer to that one.(D.3)   Why does Nuntius crash so often?        Heh.  Because you're using an old version.  Update to the latest        version, which is so much more stable you'll think you are using        someone else's program.  Great job fixing the bugs, Peter!E. SUPPORT QUESTIONS---------------------(E.1)   How can I get help with Nuntius?        Post a question to the newsgroup comp.sys.mac.comm.  Reading        that newsgroup are a number of experienced Nuntius and        Macintosh users.        Please do NOT write me with questions or problems.(E.2)   How can I receive notification of new versions of Nuntius?        You can subscribe to the listserv NUNTIUS-ANNOUNCE-L.  This        is an announcement-only list.        Send a message to <listproc@cornell.edu> with the following        one line in the body of the message:        SUBSCRIBE NUNTIUS-ANNOUNCE-L your name        For example, type "SUBSCRIBE NUNTIUS-L Tom Swift".        You will receive a confirmation with instructions on how to        communicate with the list.  KEEP THESE INSTRUCTIONS!  You may        need them later.        If you have problems with the list, please write me at        <aaron@mail.med.cornell.edu>.  I am always willing to help        subscribers (or potential subscribers) with listserv problems,        but PLEASE ask me politely.(E.3)   How do I unsubscribe from the list?        Send an E-mail message to <listproc@cornell.edu>.  Make sure        the "From:" address is the same as the address from which you        originally subscribed (that is very important!).  Type the        following one line in the body of the message:        UNSUBSCRIBE NUNTIUS-ANNOUNCE-L        Note that your name doesn't appear here.  The listserver will        send you confirmation.

For example,        a user may not have the knowledge or ability to post a        question to the newsgroup.  Hopefully, Nuntius documentation        will be forthcoming and will fill this gap.(E.6)   How do I report a bug?        First, make sure you are using the latest version of Nuntius.        Second, make sure you can reproduce the bug, maybe even on        someone else's Mac.        Third, read the FAQ to see if it is a common problem.        Fourth, read the newsgroup comp.sys.mac.comm to see if        everyone else in the world already knows about the bug.        Finally, if you have gotten this far, send a nice message to        Peter Speck at "speck@ruc.dk" with the following information:         * Your Macintosh model         * Your System version         * The version of Nuntius you are using         * Versions of any related software (Eudora, Netscape, etc.)         * As much information about the bug as possible--------------END OF THE FAQ*/
