I was having problems with 68k CodeWarrior built application crashing on
exit. From the start I suspected some sort of problem centered on
segmentation (big surprise). In the end I found that the main() function
was pragma segment'd into a segment called Main. Removing the pragma
solved the crashing problem. Why? Good question. As near as I can tell,
removing the pragma results in the main function being included in the
__%Main segment (as per the release note that came with CW 4.5 for
building MacApp 3.1.1). The segment Main (number 41 in my build) was
probably getting unloaded (?) and the attempt to return back through it on
the way out the door caused the crash. Anyone have a better explaination?

Hope this may be of some help.
