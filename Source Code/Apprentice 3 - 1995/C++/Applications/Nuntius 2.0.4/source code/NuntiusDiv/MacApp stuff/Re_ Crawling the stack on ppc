When I was working on YADP, Yet Another Dump Pef, for Jasikthis summer I found that there were some bits of code with MacsBugtype symbols. Of course these all had different formats etc, :-),so it was a massive pain to do "the right thing" for them all, butI did end up tracking down a bunch of them.I don't know if Steve will send you YADP alone, but you could ask him.He can be reached at macnosy@netcom.com or at (425)322-8114.Peter---------------------------------------------------------------------------
