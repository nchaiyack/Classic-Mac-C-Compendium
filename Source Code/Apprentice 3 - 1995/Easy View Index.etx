AppleScripting MPW
------------------
Eric Gundrum
eric@macgroup.com
Apprentice:Source Code:AppleScript:

__________
AppleScripting MPW assists you in scripting MPW, which can be a challenge. MPW offers only one useful AppleScript command: DoScript. Furthermore, MPW immediately returns an acknowledgement that the command was received. Most applications, including ToolServer do not return until the command is finished executing. MPW's immediate return from DoScript breaks with the model of an AppleScript being a series of commands executed synchronously. If your AppleScript relies on the results of the MPW script and that MPW script is not completed before the AppleScript continues, the AppleScript may not have all the necessary pieces to complete successfully. This set of AppleScripts will assist you in working around this problem.

Parrot will play back things it hears. From the author: I wrote this hack for a Halloween party. This was in the "confusion" room. A microphone picked up sounds that guests made, and at random intervals, they heard their own voices played at other parts of the room. The hack listens to the sound input device and remembers everything it hears (that is loud enough) and then plays those things back in a random order. If your Mac has stereo capability, then it also randomly chooses a speaker to play each sound. The more memory the program has allocated, the more sounds it remembers.

__________
Patmos (Protected address translation mode operating system) is an application that brings the advantages of protected mode programs to your Quadra class macintosh. By taking over the memory management unit of the 68040 (required) in a very simple kernel, we gain compatibility with the BSD unix program environment. Because of this, you can run certain programs (such as /bin/sh) designed for MacBSD, you can compile almost all GNU software including C and C++ without modifying the source code in any way; all programs run with a flat 32-meg address space, with no worries about 32K segments or the other mac paraphernalia; the majority of program bugs can be caught cleanly without crashing your mac; all your files are shared between Patmos and MacOS so you can edit using your favourite mac editor, then immediately compile in Patmos without having to reboot or copy files around.

LList Mgr 1.5
-------------
Tad Woods
70312.3552@compuserve.com
Apprentice:Source Code:Libraries:
ftp://ftp.infi.net/pub/customer/roanoke/tandtsw/
__________
LList Mgr is an alternative to the standard toolbox list manager. The advantages of LList are the abilities to have variable width columns, a different text style for each column, and lists larger than 32K. Unlike the standard list manager, LList only scrolls vertically, requires a fixed number of columns to be set when the list is created via LLNew, and entire rows, not individual cells, can be highlighted. LList has about the same performance and the function calls are similar to the toolbox list manager. LLists may contain up to 32767 rows, 32767 columns, and individual cells may contain data up to 32K. LList is pointer (not handle) based. Includes THINK C project.
Log Library 1.01
----------------
Dave Nebinger
dnebing@epix.net
Apprentice:Source Code:Libraries:

__________
Log Library is a collection of code for handling the creation and use of log files in your project. It works great for those hard to debug items like bg-apps, inits, etc. It features a component which implements the logging functions. Components are tiny extensions which the Component Manager takes care of. All you, as a programmer, have to do is open the component and by using the value returned by the Component Manager you can use the library just like it was part of your application, yet the code doesn't exist in your app. The Component Manager is part of QuickTime, AppleScript, and (supposedly) System 7.1 and up. Includes THINK C projects.
MacTCP Library
--------------
Dave Nebinger
dnebing@epix.net
Apprentice:Source Code:Libraries:

__________
MacTCP library is a set of routines for handling MacTCP stuff. It doesn't try to implement sockets on top of MacTCP, and it doesn't contain a lot of fluff. What it does provide is a thin layer over the PBControl call. Simply put, the library replaces all of the calls to PBControl with descriptive functions. For example, instead of calling PBControl with a code to open an active TCP stream, you would use the TCPActiveOpen call. All of the control is still left in the hands of the programmer. Included are two demo applications which show how to use the MacTCP library. ShowMyAddress gets the Mac's IP address and tries to look up the canonical name from the name server. Host Probe uses TCP and UDP to 'probe' a host's facilities.

Reinder Verlinde
reinder@neuretp.biol.ruu.nl
Apprentice:Source Code:Libraries:

__________
RV App Classes is an attempt to write a set of Macintosh interfaces for C++. Caveats: It is far from complete. What is most needed is support for window panes, so even the demo isn't complete; it is not completely debugged (especially the QuickDraw parts); for some reason, the gworld class does not work; needs System 7, Color QuickDraw and the drag manager; no testing on presence of needed software is performed; not easily portable to non-Mac hardware. On the plus side: class library easy to learn, both for old-time Mac programmers, and because of its small size, for beginning Mac programmers.

Its hardware components and instruction set are fixed (not too much, as we will see) but its microprogram is fully editable in a user friendly manner. The processor has access to a 128K Random Access Memory (it borrows from your Mac); you can easily view, modify, load or save this portion of memory. You can run programs and debug them with a step by step execution. Namely, you can advance by a conventional instruction, by a microinstruction, and even by a clock subcycle observing the internal parts of the processor. You can work on only one document (microprogram) at a time.

__________
Caml Light is a Mac version of a small, portable implementation of the ML language. Caml is quite close to Standard ML, though not strictly conformant. There are some slight differences in syntax and semantics, and major differences in the module system (these changes were required to support separate compilation). Caml Light is implemented as a bytecode compiler, and fully bootstrapped.  The runtime system and bytecode interpreter is written in standard C, hence Caml Light is easy to port to almost any 32 or 64 bit platform. The whole system is quite small: about 200K for the runtime system, and another 100K of bytecode for the compiler. The included source distribution contains all the files needed to recompile Caml Light from scratch.

The intent of this FKEY is to be able to avoid going to the Chooser to turn off AppleTalk every time you take your PowerBook on the road since this requires a menu item, a button click, an "Are you sure" dialog, an OK dialog and a close box. Turning it back on requires a menu item, a button click, an OK dialog and a close box. This is almost more trouble than it is worth.
