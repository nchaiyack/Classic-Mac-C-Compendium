About BoxAfter Dark About Box (ADAB) is a library code resource for implementing a scrolling text window in an After Dark help box. You supply the PICT resource and the TEXT resource and ADAB provides your module with an about box featuring your text instructions scrolling on top of your picture. ADAB works in both black & white and color. It will display the text in any color you choose and will scroll text over your picture or over a blank or colored background of your choice.by David Zwiefelhofersubversive@aol.comApprentice:Source Code:Pascal:after dark:----------Acquire Plug-InEnclosed is example source code for a Photoshop acquisition Plug-In.

Specifically, NCSA UIFlow acts as a pre-processor for UIFlow2D, a fluid dynamics program which can be run remotely on Cray computer systems or locally on a Macintosh. NCSA UIFlow takes the visual data created by the user and converts it to a form which UIFlow2D understands. NCSA UIFlow uses NCSA's Data Transfer Mechanism (DTM) when connecting to a remote host and running UIFlow2D.by NCSAbugs@ncsa.uiuc.edu (NCSA)Apprentice:Source Code:C/C++:appl:----------UNIMACRemember those super huge computers in old movies and television series, the ones with all the blinking lights?
