Doing so is free and requires only a message sent to me with information about you (and your company if you are connected to one).I will then add you to my list of registered users, and you will receive notification of future versions and beta testing opportunities. Make sure to include an e-mail address (Internet, AppleLink, America Online, or any other service with an Internet gateway).You can always find the latest version of the Infinity Windoid on the Internet FTP site ftp.i-link.com in the directory /pub/infsys. I also try to keep the Mac developer forum on AOL up to date.Troy GaulInfinity Systems	Internet:		          t-gaul@i-link.com		(preferred)America Online:	 ntwingFAX:	             		  (515) 255-2524U.S. Mail:              5090 E.P.
