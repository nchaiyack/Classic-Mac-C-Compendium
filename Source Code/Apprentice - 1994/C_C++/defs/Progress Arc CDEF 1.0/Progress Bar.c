However you can NOT removethe restrictions I've described above or add further restrictions on its use or distribution.Finally, no warranty of any kind is expressed or implied.Usage:This CDEF allows you to very easily use progress bars, ala the Finder's "Copying" dialog.To use it, copy the CDEF to your project's resource file. Add a "CNTL" to your dialog, and setthe control's ProcID to:	16*the resource ID you gave this CDEF (default ID is 600) + variation code (see below).Next set the initial, minimum and maximum values. (ie., 0, 0, 100 for a "percentage" bar).Finally, if you would like to use custom colors for the progress bar, use a variation code of1 instead of 0 and and edit the colors (stored in a corresponding 'cctb' resource) as desired.(FrameColor is used for the frame, BodyColor is used as the background color [neverreally used], TextColor is used for the "done" part of the bar, and ThumbColor is used for the"to do" part of the bar. This is the same order as they appear in Resorcerer's "CNTL" editor,so you don't have to edit the 'cctb' directly.) If you use custom controls, make sure to trythem at various bit depths to make sure QuickDraw maps the done/to do parts to differentcolors (the default colors are OK).After that, in your program all you have to do is call SetCtlValue() and this CDEF will automagically draw your progress bar!!!WARNING!! This CDEF assumes the presence of the _Gestalt trap (available in System 7 orlater.) I didn't want to include the glue code to emulate _Gestalt under System 6 (to keep thesize down).  If you need to use this in an application that may be running under System 6,just define SystemSevenOrLater to 0 instead of 1 and rebuild the code resource.If someone knows of a *supported* way to check for Color QuickDraw without calling _Gestalt,let me know and I'll include it in the next release. (_SysEnvirons turned out to be just as badsince Think adds glue code to emulate SysEnvirons on system versions earlier than 4.1 orsomething…)Thanks go to Joe Zobkiw's for his "Finder Progress" sample code (posted to alt.sources.mac byKen Long) and to Scott Knaster/Keither Rollin for their "Progress Indicator" sample in MacintoshProgramming Secrets. They made this much easier!P.S. I code in Geneva 9, so if this looks unformatted, that's why. It will look fine in any windowabout 640 pixels wide when viewed in Geneva 9. :-)E-mail comments, suggestions, requests to: egurney@vcd.hp.com 1.1: First public release1.2 changes: 	. Call StripAddress() instead of &'ing off the lower 3 bytes in calcCRgns (thanks Dave Polaschek). 	. Now determine whether or not to use custom colors via the variation code (thanks Steve LoBasso) 	. Added capability to do vertical progress bars for "thermometers". If the progress bar 	  rectangle is taller than it is wide, then the progress bar will fill "up" instead of "across". 	. Fixed a bug that prevented proper drawing when a control had a non-zero minimum. ******************************************************************/#ifdef SystemSevenOrLater#undef SystemSevenOrLater#endif#define SystemSevenOrLater 1#include <GestaltEqu.h>#include <SetUpA4.h>const unsigned char copyright[] = "Progress Bar CDEF 1.2 ©1993–94 Eddy J.
