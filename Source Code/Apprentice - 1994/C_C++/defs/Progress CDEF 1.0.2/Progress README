Progress is a CDEF (control definition) that allows you to display a thermometer progress bar, similar to the one the Finder uses when it shows you a file copy in progress. You can use it just about anywhere. I've tested it on various machines and it seems to work fine.

VERSION HISTORY
---------------
1.0.2 - added ability to set color of thermometer

1.0.1 - bug fixes

1.0.0 - initial release

INSTRUCTIONS
------------
To use the CDEF, create a CNTL with the following settings:

The BoundsRect should correspond to where you want the progress thermometer to be displayed in your dialog. Usually, a thermometer is wide and short.

Value is the starting value of the thermometer. This is usually set in your program.

Visible should be set to true.

Max and Min should be set to number like 100 and 0 respectively.

ProcID should be set to (CDEF ID * 16) + Variation. I've set the CDEF ID to 37, so in most cases, the ProcID should be set to 576. There are no additional variations available.

RefCon should be set to the color you want for the thermometer. To make life easy, the CDEF only supports the old-style colors:

1 - red
2 - green
3 - blue
4 - cyan
5 - magenta
6 - yellow
7 - white

Any other number will set the color of the thermometer to black.

Titles are ignored.
