INTRODUCTION		
SliderCDEF is a control definition function for a
slider with a simple indicator and a track without
arrows on the end and that also displays the slider's
value centered above the indicator outside the
control's rectangle. The slider uses offscreen
graphics worlds and VBL tasks to give smooth animation
of the thumb as it is dragged around the track.
However, the slider is still incomplete: it only
handles horizontal configurations, it doesn't have
a disabled state, and it requires System 7.0 and color. 
Since many peoply have been asking for slider control
on the net lately, I thought I'd release it without
it being completely finished. In its present state is
is clear and well documented and could be easily
modified for more specific needs.

The archive contains source code written with
Think C 5.04 as well as a resource file containing
the CDEF, and a small demonstration application. The
archive is Stuffit 3.0 and has been binhexed.

SliderCDEF is provided free of charge, however if
you do use it in a piece of software or make
significant improvements, I'd like to hear about it
and see the results.


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
SliderCDEF should be enhanced to handle vertical
sliders and to display a disabled state. It should
probably use DeviceLoop to do its drawing so that
it could be properly displayed across different
monitors. Some portions could be better optimized
in the quest to eliminate more flickering. Finally,
other parts could be added to the the slider such
as arrows on either end. This could be another
variation of the slider.
