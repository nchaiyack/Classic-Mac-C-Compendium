NeXT CDEF PackageMay 4, 1994Version 1.0? 1.1?by Hiep Dam3G SoftwareNOTE: The NeXT CDEF  Tester application requires COLOR QUICKDRAW and SYSTEM 7 or later. Running this on other platforms will result in a horrible, ghastly death! (No, the application doesn't do error checking...)The tester app and source code is in the public domain.The NeXT CDEF source code and cdef are copyright © 1994 Hiep Dam, but you may use both freely in your own projects without any restrictions. I retain all rights, however. It would be nice, though, if you would give me credit if you do use the cdef or source code.Contacting the author:America Online:  StarLabsDelphi              : StarLabsInternet           : starlabs@aol.com, or starlabs@delphi.comImagineNet      : starlabs@aspiring.mac.game.designer (just kidding ya)Hiep Dam2226 Parkside Avenue #302Los Angeles, CA 90031
