About Slider Control GH  v 1.1 4/24/94The file "Flag Control GH (rsrc)" contains a CDEF of id 1864. This CDEF implementsa control which implements a simple slider similar in function (if notappearance) to the slider used by Apple in their Sound control panel. ========== changes ============¥ implemented solid dragging of control¥ removed inpageup, inpagedown control parts===============================¥ For examples where this is control is used, look at Speak Note GH 2.0,  and Siege Watch 2.0  ¥ CNTL resources which used this CDEF should use a proc ID of 29824.¥ DLOGs should have an auxillary color resource, so the Dialog Manager  knows enough to use a color window when appropriate.  ¥ If used in a document window, be sure to use a color window when  color quickdraw is available.¥ I've included all the source code for this control in the files: Slider.c,  Slider.h, utilities.c and utilities.h. Feel free to modify the code for  your own projects and send along bug fixes and suggestions to me.¥ I used Think C 5 to compile this project.¥ Thanks to Leonard Roesenthol for providing a few lines of very important  code.¥ Thanks to the good folks at Symantec for providing some sample code in  Think Reference 2.0¥ If you do use this control in a released program, send me a postcard  describing it.¥ If you bundle this package in a CD-ROM such as the Sumex CD-ROM send me  a copy of the first edition it appears on.**************Glenn R.
