About Flag Control GH 1.0 4/24/94
The file "Flag Control GH (rsrc)" contains a CDEF of id 932. This CDEF implements
a control which acts exactly like the toggle switches found in the Finder's
text views. This control has not changed since its original release.

¥ For an example where this is control is used, look at Siege Watch 2.0.
  
¥ CNTL resources which used this CDEF should use a proc ID of 14912

¥ I've included all the source code for this control in the files: FlagCDEF.c,
  FlagCDEF.h, utilities.c and utilities.h. Feel free to modify the code for
  your own projects and send along bug fixes and suggestions to me.

¥ DLOGs should have an auxillary color resource, so the Dialog Manager
  knows enough to use a color window when appropriate.
  
¥ If used in a document window, be sure to use a color window when
  color quickdraw is available.
  
¥ I used Think C 5 to compile this project.

¥ Thanks to Leonard Roesenthol for providing a few lines of very important
  code.

¥ Thanks to the good folks at Symantec for providing some sample code in
  Think Reference 2.0

¥ If you do use this control in a released program, send me a postcard
  describing it.

¥ If you bundle this package in a CD-ROM such as the Sumex CD-ROM send me
  a copy of the first edition it appears on.
