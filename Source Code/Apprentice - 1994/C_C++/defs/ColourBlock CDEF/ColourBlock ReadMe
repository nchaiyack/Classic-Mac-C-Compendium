ColourBlock ReadMe
------------------

ColourBlock is a CDEF for retrieving a block of colour from the user. THINK C 6.0 source and a compiled
version are included in this archive.


	• CNTL resources which use this CDEF should use a proc ID of 14000. The resource ID of
	  the ColourBlock CDEF is 900 - there are no variation codes.
  
	• The colour is held in a data structure attached to each control, a handle to which is left
	  in the contrlData field of the control. Your app should read/set the value in this structure,
	  and call Draw1Control when it wants to update the on-screen value. See ColourBlock.h for
	  the format.

	• The CDEF *assumes* that Colour Quickdraw is present.

	• The CDEF will return inCheckBox when the control is selected.

	• The CDEF doesn't attempt to be sensible when it's placed on a display with a small colour
	  depth. Disable the control if it's not feasible to use it to  pick colours with. It also doesn't
	  attempt to dither the colour blocks.
  
	• The source code, and the CDEF, are freeware - you may use them, without notice, in
	  anything you write.

	• If you find any bugs, or have any comments, feel free to send me some email. This was
	  just done as a quick hack, so there may well be some.
