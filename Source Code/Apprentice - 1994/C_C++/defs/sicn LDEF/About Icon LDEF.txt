About SICN LDEF -

	Makes a list similar to those in Std File Dialog: an 16x16 icon with text
	to the right. Cell data should be of the format:
	
	
		<Small Icon Data> <Text Data>
		   (32 Bytes)      (? Bytes)
		    
		             - or -
	
		<Arbitrary Data Not for Display>
		           (? Bytes)
	            
	 
	 This LDEF was fixed to run on 68000 Macs. I dont know if there was a later
	 version, but the PlotSICN() call was getting called with an odd address 
	 occasionally. I didnt do much cleaning of the code, so maybe compare this
	 LDEF to mine to get a picture of how to build your own.
