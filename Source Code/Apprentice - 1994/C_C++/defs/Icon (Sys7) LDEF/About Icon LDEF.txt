About Icon LDEF -

	Makes a list similar to the Chooser: a system 7 icon with text
	underneath. Cell data should be of the format:
	
	
		<Icon Suite Handle> <Text Data>
		    (4 Bytes)        (? Bytes)
		    
		             - or -
	
		<Arbitrary Data Not for Display>
		           (? Bytes)
	            
	 
	 Because of the manner the icons are stored and displayed, the
	 LDEF requires System 7 or later. Placing a Nil handle in the
	 first 4 Bytes will leave the icon blank white.
	 
	 Do not let the system auto-calc the cell size (by passing size
	 (0,0)), or your icons wont fit. Cells should be (40, 60) to 
	 accomodate the icons and titles.
