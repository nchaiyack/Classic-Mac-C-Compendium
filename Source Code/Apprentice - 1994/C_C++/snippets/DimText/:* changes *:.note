v. 1.1 changes:---------------In the bottleneck proc, save and restore the pen state.  This is forcompatibility with custom controls.In the bottleneck proc, reset the clipping region when calling FrameRect.Previously, if the editText item contained more than could be displayed,then was dimmed, and then erased and updated, the frame was not drawn.In Dim_text, after turning a dimmed item back to an editable text item,call SelIText( dp, item, 0, 0 );.  This was to fix this situation: Sayyou typed more into an edit field that could be displayed.  When thefield was dimmed, part would disappear, because of the fact that statictext is displayed with a different destRect. Then when the item wasundimmed, the text that had disappeared did not come back.  Now, withthe change, the text still disappears, but comes back.Modified for universal headers.
