	Hi there!
	
	After craving a multi-get dialog box for a while, I finally got the time
	to write one. And since I could never find one on-line, I'm uploading it
	far and wide (or at least to cis/aol/sumex). It works, and _should_ work
	under MPW & Think. The methods are a little ugly (stringtonum), but hey,
	you can write your own if you want.
	
	Potential improvements:
		¥ Filtering out the files already in the list. This doesn't really
		  bother me, but if you want, the fileFilter function is ready.
		¥ Better System 6 behavior. Actually, I'm not sure what the thing
		  looks like under 6. Probably the auto-centering is off, the
		  button isn't hilited, & the enter keys don't work.
	
	If you use this, feel free to send me a copy of the program ;)
