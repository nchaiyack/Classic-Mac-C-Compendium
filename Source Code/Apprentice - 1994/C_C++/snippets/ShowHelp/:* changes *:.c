#if justacomment2.0---Eliminated use of A4-based globals, in favor of tacking more informationonto the dialog record.Made it possible to switch to other applications or use the applicationor help menu, if the dialog is not of type dBoxProc. Made it possiblefor the dialog to be moved, if it has a drag region.  Added the callbackfor window updating to the Show_help API.  Added Fake_ModalDialog().1.8 (unreleased, but used in Carpetbag 1.2.2)---Changed programmatic interface.  Now a 'Hlp?' resource contains most ofthe information that was formerly being passed as parameters.In Save_text, remove base_pict_id parameter, and get pict informationfrom the array tacked onto the dialog record.PICTS can now be compressed.In Scroll_text, changed a parameter declaration from int to short.This prevents problems for those using 4-byte ints.Disposed of the handle to the deferred highlight array, which wasformerly a memory leak.Saved and restored the GrafPort around the SFPutFile call in Save_text.Removed LoadResource call from Draw_picts, since the PicHandles may nowbe the results of decompression, not resources.Eliminated High_hook_glue routine, by modifying High_hook.1.7---Changed handling of A4 in the main routine.1.6---Added the Push_highlight and Pop_highlight routines, and made thearray of deferred highlights into a handle that can be resized at need.This was to fix a crash that occurred when drag-selecting underJapanese system software.#endif
