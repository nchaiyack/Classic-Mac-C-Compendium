From: vosse@ruls41.LeidenUniv.nl (Theo Vosse)Subject: Code for reading digital audio with a CD300; here it is!Hi.As promised (in comp.sys.mac.programmer), my code to get digital audiodirectly from CD into your mac. Beware, you need an Apple CD 300!!!You can specify the section you want to download and in what formatyou want to save it (8/16 bit, mono/stereo, 11/22/44 kHz). The soundis always saved as a system 7 sound, which means that you need SoundManager 3.0 to be able to play 16 bit sounds!The code is intended for use with THINK C 5. I suppose you'll have togo through some trouble when you're using another compiler. Theprogram is more or less (well, less) in mac style: initially, it showsyou a dialog in which you can specify begin and end track and time,plus some conversion options. You need 176400 bytes of RAM for everysecond of digital audio you are downloading, even if you convert itdirectly to mono, 8 bits, 22kHz. The (dialog) resources are includedat the end.The code is pretty straightforward, although the function MaxVal(),used for normalization of the sound, contains some quirks: for somesounds it introduces an ugly clipping effect! Originally, I programmed some SCSI-routines to read the data (that wasbefore I knew there was a cleaner way to do it with ToolBox calls).For completeness sake, I have included the SCSI parts at the end. Theywere partially derived from code by Thomas R. Shaw. The relevantinformation from the cdrom-faq is also included.If you have any questions, comment or praising remarks, feel free topost them or mail them to me. Have fun!	Theo Vosse	----------	Unit for Experimental Psychology	University of Leiden	The Netherlands
