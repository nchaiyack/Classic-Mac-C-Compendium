// Stu’sThreadUtils// // (C) 6th March 1994  Stuart Cheshire <cheshire@cs.stanford.edu>// Stu’sThreadUtils is an ongoing development to make useful ThreadManagerroutines available to the public.I wrote it because Apple’s Thread Manager is a great step forward tohelping more developers create multi-threaded applications, with allthe benefits that can bring to us end-users, so I’m very happy about it.However, the facilities provided by Apple’s Thread Manager are very rawand minimal, and the supplimentary routines provided in Apple’s ThreadUtilsleave much to be desired, and are more likely to put people off threadprogramming than encourage them.Because of this, I wrote my own ThreadUtils. They are simple, elegant,and efficient, and should make people’s lives much easier when they aretrying to write threaded code.There are three files in this package (so far):// ThreadSynch.c/h// This file defines thread synchronization primitives:// Semaphores, Mutual exclusion locks, and Condition variables.// Pipeline.c/h// An example of a library using mutual exclusion locks, and condition// variables to implement a producers/consumers pipeline// test.c// Example code to use the above files.
