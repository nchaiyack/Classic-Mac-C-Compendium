Teeson     CIS:		72647,3674    AppleLink:	CDA0197 	Date:		1 June 1993   	Path:IconShow:EasyShow++:ReadMeES.note 	  	• The files in the project:  	  		(0) The documentation in the ReadMeES and ReadMeIS.notes  		(1) EasyShow++.cp is the main routine  		(2) ES++.rsrc is a resource file with the various icon families  		    used to display the animated frames (ID's 1000, 1010, 1020) or  		    the 'Not loaded' icon (1030) if the mouse button or shift key  		    is held down.  		      		    By having this file in the project you can double click on it and  		    launch ResEdit from within the project, make your changes, and when  		    you quit ResEdit you end up back in your project.  		      		    Don't forget to compile the ES++.rsrc so that a suitable  		    EasyShow++.π.rsrc file is created for you before you begin debugging  		    or building the INIT.  		(3) IconShow++.cp is the routine called to display the icon  		(4) MacTraps is for the toolbox calls  		(5) RuntimeMath.o is from the Standard Libraries:C++ Sources:CPlusLib:  		(6) SITable.cp is the implementation of the class library   		(7) SITable.h is the declaration of the class library  			• Developing this INIT 			There are two distinct phases in developing this INIT namely: 		(0) developing and debugging it as an app and 		(1) building it as a code resource of type INIT		There are other methods to debug but one way to do it is to establish	a flag in each file that will conditionally compile code depending on whether 	you are debugging as an app or building a code resource. 		A Symantec specific way is to use the predefined macro __A4_GLOBALS__	which is defined to be 1 if the project is a code resource but otherwise	isn't defined at all. 			Examine the EasyShow++.cp file for an example of how to do this.		• Developing and Debugging as an app:		(0) Use the 'Project' menu to 'Set Project Type…' to Application				You should now be able to step though all of the code.		• Building a code resource of type INIT	    (0) Use the 'Project' menu to 'Set Project Type…' to: 	  		Project type to Code Resource,   			File type to 'INIT',   			Creator to 'ES++',			// must match the Signature in your Bundle  			Name to 'EasyShow++', 		  			Resource type to 'INIT',   			ID = 1,   			Attrs = 50.  		  		You should now be able to Build Code Resource…   		(only use SmartLink if you have version C++ 6.0.1 or higher.)  		  	Peter Teeson
