14 March 1994This code is a  Symantec C++ 6.0.1 version of how to display INIT icons at startup. Without the wonderful THINK products, from Symantec, programming would actually be work!To install:Refer to Fig. 10-4 on page 174 of the THINK C User's Guide(0) Drag the 'IconShow++ Ä' folder into your THINK 'Project Manager' folder(1) Drag the 'EasyShow Ä' folder into your 'Development' or 'Other Projects' folder(2) Open the EasyShow++.¹(3) To update and run it, choose 'Run' from the 'Project' menuEasyShow++ is an example project that uses the IconShow++ files.It is a good place from which to start exploring things but be sure to read the ReadMeIS and ReadMeES notes by double clicking on them after you have launched the project.While I retain the copyright, this code is placed in the public domain as postcardware. This means nobody can charge you for it, you can use it in your code at no charge,and you cannot charge anybody for it. But I would appreciate a postcard from you if you would take the time.If you redistribute it you must include all the files unaltered and as distributed by me.Peter Teeson#712 - 24 Forest Manor Road,Willowdale ONCanadaM2J 1M3CIS: 72647,3674    AppleLink: CDA0197
