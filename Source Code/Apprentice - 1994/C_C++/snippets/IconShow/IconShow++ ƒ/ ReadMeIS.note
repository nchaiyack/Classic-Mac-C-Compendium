Without the wonderful THINK products, from Symantec, programming 	would actually be work!	 	I studied and learned from others, specifically:			(0) ShowINIT.asm (v1.1b2) by Paul Mercer, Darin Adler,Paul Snively, 		Steve Capps et al.			(1) ShowIcon7.c by James W. Walker which was based on Patrick C. Beard's 		ShowIconFamily.c, which in turn was derived from the original ShowINIT					(2) 'An Example INIT' from THINK Reference 'Code Example Orphans' in Managers		(3) The helpful comments in the Symantec SYMDEVTOOLS CIS forum from 		Dennis Brothers, Phil Shapiro, Brian Fitzgerald, Steve Stockman, 		Ken Broomfield, Steve Zellers, and others.			(4) The grey book: The C++ Programming Language 2nd Edition Bjarne Stroustrup		Addison-Wesley ISBN 0-201-53992-6			(5) The purple book: Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms James O.
