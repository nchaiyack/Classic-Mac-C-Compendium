Look up the structures and callsI use in it, since this code may be a little disorganized (and thus hardto follow)..-------------------------The words in all CAPS are self-defined OFFSETS in a block of data.Look at the AFPVolMountInfo Record for thepb is a ParamBlockRec into which myMount gets loaded into.Also, as with most calls all the strings are pascal strings.Hope this helps, any more questions, send me email atctr@pyrite.som.cwru.edu
