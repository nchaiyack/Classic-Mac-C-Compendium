// ----- A GIF reading routine - by François Pottier <pottier@dmi.ens.fr>
// ----- April 16th, 1994
// ----- Best viewed in Geneva 9, with 4 character tabs

// ----- Originally based on code by Patrick J. Naughton, greatly modified since then.

// ----- Input : a file specification and a flag longword to be passed to NewGWorld
// ----- The file size is also given as input because in my case the caller happens to have it at hand.
// ----- Output : an 8 bit deep GWorld with the picture. Pixels locked.

// ----- The routine is rather fast, and uses a minimum amount of memory: only about 15K (plus the GWorld size, of course),
// ----- whatever the GIF file size. It uses a buffer to read chunks of the file - you can change the buffer size by modifying the
// ----- BufferSize #define.

// ----- Note on reliability: I have been using this code in a shareware product for several months and it works fine.
// ----- IMHO this is good quality code.

// ----- You can use this code freely. I only have two requests: 1. that you give me proper credit in your About box, and
// ----- 2. that you tell me if you improve this code. Have fun!
