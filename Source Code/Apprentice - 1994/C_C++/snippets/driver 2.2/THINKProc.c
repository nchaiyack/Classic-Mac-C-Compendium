/* *	THINKProc.c by Pete Resnick. This source file should be compiled in *	THINK C in a seperate project as a code resource. The resource type *	is defined in driver.c as 'PROC' and the resource ID is defined as 128 *	in drvrincludes.h. The ID canbe changed if necessary. This code *	actually replaces the call to GetResource in THINK C's driver glue. *	Instead of the driver DATA resource and multi-segment DCOD resources *	being in the driver's resource file, they are detached handles in the *	system heap and are literally "tacked on" to the bottom of this piece *	of code: attached to the end of the pointer containing *THIS* code is *	an array of handles and resource ID's. The code returns the handle to *	the correct detached resource. */#include "drvrincludes.h"#include <SetUpA4.h>/* *	Global variables are stored at the end of the code segment. With *	resRec, we have a zero-filled structure at the end of the code segment *	which can server as a marker. */RsrcRec resRec = {nil, 0, 0};pascal Handle main(ResType theTyp, short theID){	Size theSize;	RsrcRec *resPtr;	Ptr codePtr;		RememberA0();	SetUpA4();		/* Get the starting address of the code segment */	asm { move.l a4, codePtr }		/* Figure out how big the pointer is and start at the end */	theSize = GetPtrSize(codePtr);	resPtr = (RsrcRec *)(codePtr + theSize);		/* Look for the handle with the correct resource ID */	while(((--resPtr)->rsrc != nil) &&	      ((resPtr->id != theID) || (resPtr->typ != theTyp)))		/* Do nothing */ ;	RestoreA4();	return(resPtr->rsrc);}
