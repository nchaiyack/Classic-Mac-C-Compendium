	This is the source code for a program to
demonstrate how to do 3D perspective drawing and
clipping.  It's written as a sort of crude flight
simulator - you "fly" through a rather simple world.
It also shows how to do simple animation.	
	All math is fixed-point to make the speed tolerable
on feebler Macs.  With an FPU the speed would be roughly
the same using floating point.
	The package contains the source code, a ThinkC
vers.5.0.3 project, and an executable version compiled
for any Mac.

	It'll run much faster with color turned off (rather
too fast on a Quadra).
