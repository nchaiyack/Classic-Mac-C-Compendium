All you have to do is	tell the progress indicator routines what port you want to draw in, the	rectangle you want to use, and the maximum value for your indicator.	Later, you’ll make repeated calls to update your progress value (which can	be anything from zero to the maximum value), which will update the	“thermometer” in the window.*******************************************************************************/void InitProgressIndicator(GrafPtr ourPort, Rect r, long max){	pProgressPort = ourPort;	pRect = r;	pMax = max;	pCurrent = 0;	pLastCurrent = 0;	pLastBorder = 0;}/*******************************************************************************	SetProgress	Call this periodically to update the indicator. Pass in the new value that	the indicator is supposed to represent. The value passed in will be	clipped between 0 and the maximum value.*******************************************************************************/void SetProgress(long absoluteAmount){	pCurrent = absoluteAmount;	DrawProgressBar();}/*******************************************************************************	SetProgressDelta	Call this periodically to update the indicator. Pass in a delta value to	be added to the current value. The result will be clipped between 0 and	the maximum value. The indicator will them be updated to indicate the new	current value.	This routine returns TRUE if we hit or passed the maximum value. This	could be handy to determine if we are done doing whatever periodic task we	are representing.*******************************************************************************/Boolean SetProgressDelta(long delta){	pCurrent += delta;	DrawProgressBar();	return (pCurrent >= pMax);}/*******************************************************************************	DrawProgressBar	Internal routine to update internal variables after the client has called	SetProgress() or SetProgressDelta(). It calculates the width of the new	rectangle; if it’s changed since the last time, we call our update routine.*******************************************************************************/void DrawProgressBar(){	short		border;	short		rectWidth;	if ((pLastCurrent != pCurrent) && (pCurrent <= pMax)) {		pLastCurrent = pCurrent;		rectWidth = pRect.right - pRect.left - 2;		border = pRect.left + 1 + rectWidth * pCurrent / pMax;		if (pLastBorder != border) {			pLastBorder = border;			UpdateProgressBar();		}	}}/*******************************************************************************	UpdateProgressBar	Performs the actual drawing of the indicator. This routine is called	internally from other progress indicator routine to draw the new state of	the indicator. However, it can also be called in response to update events	by outside clients.*******************************************************************************/void UpdateProgressBar(){	GrafPtr		oldPort;	RGBColor	oldForeColor;	RGBColor	oldBackColor;	Rect		doneRect;	Rect		toDoRect;	doneRect = pRect;	InsetRect(&doneRect, 1, 1);	toDoRect = doneRect;	doneRect.right = toDoRect.left = pLastBorder;	GetPort(&oldPort);	SetPort(pProgressPort);	GetForeColor(&oldForeColor);	GetBackColor(&oldBackColor);	PenNormal();	SetFrameColor();	FrameRect(&pRect);	SetDoneColor();	PaintRect(&doneRect);	SetToDoColor();	PaintRect(&toDoRect);	RGBForeColor(&oldForeColor);	RGBBackColor(&oldBackColor);	SetPort(oldPort);}/*******************************************************************************	Progress indicator color routines.	These are called to set the colors for the three different parts of the	progress indicator: the frame, the “Done” part (the stuff on the left side	of the indicator), and the “To Do” part (the stuff on the right).	Note that we only check to see if we have Color QuickDraw or not; we don’t	also make a check to see how deep our monitor is. Instead, we simply let	QuickDraw match the color we specify to one most closely matching it on	whatever screen we’re drawing.	However, if we only set the foreground color, we run headfirst into	QuickDraw as it tries to help us out behind our backs. Take the case of	setting the “To Do” color. For that color, we use red = 0xCCCC, green =	0xCCCC, and blue = 0xFFFF. This gives us a nice steel blue color in 8-bit	mode, and a nice light gray in 4- and 2- bit modes. However, it draws as	black in 1-bit mode, when we expect and need it to draw in white.	What’s happening is this: when QuickDraw takes the color you specify and	tries to match it to one of the colors in the screen device’s color table,	it makes a special check to see if it maps your color into the background	color. If so, it inverts the color and tries again. In our case, our steel	blue gets mapped into white, which is the background color. QuickDraw says	“Oops! I’m about to draw something that won’t show up, so I’ll use a	different color, instead!” So it changes {0xCCCC, 0xCCCC, 0xFFFF} into	{0x3333, 0x3333, 0x0000} and remaps it. This time, the color maps into	black, which is what QuickDraw ends up using.	To avoid this feature, we take control of the background color. When we	want our light colors to map into white, we change the background color to	black, avoiding any conflict. Alternatively, we could attach a palette to	our window containing the two colors we want as “courteous” entries. This	is sufficient to get QuickDraw to stop being so helpful.*******************************************************************************/const RGBColor	kBlack		= {0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000};const RGBColor	kWhite		= {0xFFFF, 0xFFFF, 0xFFFF};const RGBColor	kDarkGrey	= {0x4000, 0x4000, 0x4000};const RGBColor	kSteelBlue	= {0xCCCC, 0xCCCC, 0xFFFF};void SetFrameColor(){	if (gMac.hasColorQD) {		RGBForeColor(&kBlack);		RGBBackColor(&kWhite);	} else {		PenPat(qd.black);	}}void SetDoneColor(){	if (gMac.hasColorQD) {		RGBForeColor(&kDarkGrey);		RGBBackColor(&kWhite);	} else {		PenPat(qd.black);	}}void SetToDoColor(){	if (gMac.hasColorQD) {		RGBForeColor(&kSteelBlue);		RGBBackColor(&kBlack);	} else {		PenPat(qd.white);	}}
