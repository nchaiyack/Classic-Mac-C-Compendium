							entire indicator is drawn within this rectangle.

							inset by a pixel to draw the insides. */

							any value. The indicator is drawn such that the
							ratio of the completed part to the entire part is
							the same as the current value to the max value. */

							InitProgressIndicator. It is updated by calling

	tell the progress indicator routines what port you want to draw in, the
	rectangle you want to use, and the maximum value for your indicator.
	Later, you�ll make repeated calls to update your progress value (which can
	be anything from zero to the maximum value), which will update the
	�thermometer� in the window.

/*******************************************************************************

	Progress indicator color routines.

	These are called to set the colors for the three different parts of the
	progress indicator: the frame, the �Done� part (the stuff on the left side
	of the indicator), and the �To Do� part (the stuff on the right).

	Note that we only check to see if we have Color QuickDraw or not; we don�t
	also make a check to see how deep our monitor is. Instead, we simply let
	QuickDraw match the color we specify to one most closely matching it on
	whatever screen we�re drawing.

	However, if we only set the foreground color, we run headfirst into
	QuickDraw as it tries to help us out behind our backs. Take the case of
	setting the �To Do� color. For that color, we use red = 0xCCCC, green =
	0xCCCC, and blue = 0xFFFF. This gives us a nice steel blue color in 8-bit
	mode, and a nice light gray in 4- and 2- bit modes. However, it draws as
	black in 1-bit mode, when we expect and need it to draw in white.

	What�s happening is this: when QuickDraw takes the color you specify and
	tries to match it to one of the colors in the screen device�s color table,
	it makes a special check to see if it maps your color into the background
	color. If so, it inverts the color and tries again. In our case, our steel
	blue gets mapped into white, which is the background color. QuickDraw says
	�Oops! I�m about to draw something that won�t show up, so I�ll use a
	different color, instead!� So it changes {0xCCCC, 0xCCCC, 0xFFFF} into
	{0x3333, 0x3333, 0x0000} and remaps it. This time, the color maps into
	black, which is what QuickDraw ends up using.

	To avoid this feature, we take control of the background color. When we
	want our light colors to map into white, we change the background color to
	black, avoiding any conflict. Alternatively, we could attach a palette to
	our window containing the two colors we want as �courteous� entries. This
	is sufficient to get QuickDraw to stop being so helpful.
