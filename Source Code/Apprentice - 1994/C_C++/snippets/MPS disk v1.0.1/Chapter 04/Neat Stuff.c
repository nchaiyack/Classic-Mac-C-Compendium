When creating these dialogs, there are three approaches we	can take. The first is to create these dialogs as needed and to dispose of	them when we are done. The second is to create all of these dialogs at	application startup time and keep them around for the life of the program.	When they arenÕt needed, they are simply hidden. One advantage to this is	that dialogs reappear where the user left them. A third approach lies	somewhere between the first two approaches, where the dialogs are created	as needed, but are hidden when no longer needed. We take this third	approach here.	On handling movable-modal dialogs:	Movable-modal dialogs are hybrid windows. They mostly look like modeless	dialogs in that they have a drag region and title bar, but they also have	the bold rectangle framing them reminiscent of modal dialogs.	The purpose of movable-modal dialogs is to allow most of the flexibility	of modeless dialogs in cases where you would normally display a modal	dialog. The benefits the user gains are that they can move the dialog	around so that they can see parts of their other windows, and that they	can switch to other running applications. At the same time, they are in a	semi-modal state in that they canÕt select any other windows in the	application, and most menu items are disabled.	Handling movable-modal dialogs is kind of tricky.  Because the user is	allowed to switch to other applications, and because the application must	update background windows it owns as the dialog is moved around, the	application _cannot_ call ModalDialog on movable-modal windows. This means	that another approach needs to be taken.	Fortunately, an alternate solution is not very difficult to implement. The	first thing to do is define a global variable that gets set to TRUE when a	movable-modal dialog is shown. In our case, this variable is called	ÒgInModalState.Ó When that variable is set to TRUE, two things happen.	First, our event handling routine makes a special examination of	mouse-down events. Only mouse-downs in the movable-modal window and in the	menubar are allowed. Second, our menu setup routine disables most of the	menu items.*******************************************************************************//*******************************************************************************	Global Variables.*******************************************************************************/short	gCurrentRadio;				/*	Item number of the currently selected										radio button. */Boolean	gCurrentFlippedState;		/*	The current state of our command-key										hints.

We do a few things here. First, we	load in the dialog. We have it marked as invisible in the resource so we	can futz with it a little bit before showing it on the screen. Next, we	set one of the radio buttons (you always need at least _one_ radio button	marked). We also fiddle with the items that get flipped when we hold down	the command key. Since we are just bringing up the dialog, we set those	items to their Òcommand-key-is-not-downÓ state.	Once that is done, we can show the dialog. To do this, we simply use	ShowWindow. After all, a DialogPtr is the same as a WindowPtr. When the	window is shown, we call ModalDialog and let the System handle mouse downs	and keypresses. When something interesting happens, ModalDialog  returns,	telling us the number of the item that was selected. In other words, if	the user clicked on the OK button, we receive the ID number of the OK	button.	We look at the item number and decide what to do next. If a radio button	is clicked on, we select it and deselect the previous button. If a	checkbox is selected, we toggle its setting. If the OK or Cancel buttons	are hit, we close the dialog box and exit this function.*******************************************************************************/void	DoMusicMaker(void){	short		itemHit;	DialogPtr	ourDialog;	ourDialog = GetNewDialog(kMusicMakerDialog, NIL, (WindowPtr) -1);	gCurrentRadio = 0;	SetRadioButton(ourDialog, kFirstRadio);	gCurrentFlippedState = TRUE;		/* To force the update in ... */	FlipItems(ourDialog, FALSE);		/* ... this call to FlipItems. */	ShowWindow(ourDialog);	do {		ModalDialog(OurFilter, &itemHit);		if ((itemHit >= kFirstRadio) && (itemHit <= kLastRadio))			SetRadioButton(ourDialog, itemHit);		else if ((itemHit >= kFirstCheckBox) && (itemHit <= kLastCheckBox))			ToggleCheckBox(ourDialog, itemHit);	} while ((itemHit != ok) && (itemHit != cancel));	DisposeDialog(ourDialog);}/*******************************************************************************	OurFilter	This routine is passed to ModalDialog as a Òfilter procedureÓ. This means	that it is called in the core loop of ModalDialog to handle any custom	actions. For instance, in this routine, we handle certain command-key	combinations, as well as Enter, Return, and Esc key presses. We also	handle the display of the command-key hints if the command key is down,	and the drawing of the frames around the OK button and the icon.	The first thing this routine does is show the command-key hints if the	command key is down. Since the user can press the command key at any time,	we check on Null events to see if it is down. If so, we show the hints.	Otherwise, we remove the hints from the screen. All of this hint showing	and hiding is handled by calling FlipItems with a Boolean indicating	whether we want the hints shown or not.	If the user presses a key, weÕd like to take a look at it and see if we	want to act on it. If the user presses Return or Enter, we simulate a	click on the OK button. If the user presses Command-Period or Esc, we	simulate a click on the Cancel button. If the user presses one of the	special command keys that corresponds to a radio button or checkbox, we	simulate a click on one of those. All clicks are simulated by setting	ÒitemHitÓ to the ID number of the item we want to click on.	We also handle update events. This is so we can frame the OK button and	the icon. We put a frame around the OK button because all good Macintosh	programs should frame the button that gets selected when the user presses	Return or Enter. We frame the icon because one of my friends says it looks	better that way.	Notice that we frame the OK button a little differently than the way	Inside Mac says to. On page I-407, it tells us to draw a 3 pixel thick	roundrect with corner radii of 16 pixels. However, if youÕve ever followed	that advice for really big buttons, youÕll see that the result looks	really dumb. This is because the buttons themselves are not always drawn	with a 16 pixel radius, which means that the button and frame donÕt always	nest correctly. Therefore, we use the same algorithm the Control Manager	uses to determine the corner radius, which is to take the height of the	button and divide it by 2. However, we donÕt let the value for the radius	get too small, or else it starts looking stupid again. So we make sure the	vertical radius is always at least 16 pixels; this seems to look pretty	good.	Finally, a note on the Boolean value we have to return for this function.	This Boolean value is a signal to the Dialog Manager. If we return TRUE,	we are telling the Dialog Manager that we did everything that needed to be	done for that particular event, and that it doesnÕt need to do anything	except return to its event loop and call GetNextEvent. However, if we	return FALSE, we tell the dialog manager to do what it would normally do.	So in the case of the update event, we _augment_ what is normally done by	drawing our stuff, and then returning FALSE to tell the Dialog Manager to	update everything _it_ is responsible for. In the case of Null events, we	handling the drawing of our command-key hints, and then return FALSE to	the Dialog Manager to let it do whatever it needs to do at idle time, like	blink the insertion point. On the other hand, if the user presses Return,	Enter, Esc, or one of the magic Command keys we look out for, we return	TRUE because we donÕt want the Dialog Manager to do what it would normally	do with those key presses (which is to enter them into any EditText items	which might be active).*******************************************************************************/pascal Boolean OurFilter(DialogPtr dlg, EventRecord *event, short *itemHit){	short	iKind;	Handle	iHandle;	Rect	iRect;	char	keys[] = "BHWATPFSR";	char	key;	short	loopy;	short	radius;	switch (event->what) {		case nullEvent:			if (event->modifiers & cmdKey)			/* Command key down */				FlipItems(dlg, TRUE);			else				FlipItems(dlg, FALSE);			return FALSE;			break;		case keyDown:		case autoKey:			key = event->message & charCodeMask;			if (event->modifiers & cmdKey) {		/* Command key down */				key = UprChar(key);				if (key == kPeriod) {					*itemHit = cancel;					FlashDialogItem(dlg, *itemHit);				}				for (loopy = cstrlen(keys) - 1 ; loopy >= 0 ; --loopy) {					if (key == keys[loopy]) {						*itemHit = loopy + kFirstRadio;					}				}				return TRUE;			/* This says we handle ALL command keys */			} else {				if ((key == kReturn) || (key == kEnter)) {					*itemHit = ok;					FlashDialogItem(dlg, *itemHit);					return TRUE;				}				if (key == kEscape) {					*itemHit = cancel;					FlashDialogItem(dlg, *itemHit);					return TRUE;				}			}			return FALSE;		case updateEvt:			SetPort(dlg);			GetDItem(dlg, ok, &iKind, &iHandle, &iRect);			InsetRect(&iRect, -4, -4);			radius = (iRect.bottom - iRect.top) / 2;			if (radius < 16)				radius = 16;			PenNormal();			PenSize(3,3);			FrameRoundRect(&iRect, radius, radius);			GetDItem(dlg, kIconID, &iKind, &iHandle, &iRect);			InsetRect(&iRect, -3, -3);			PenSize(2, 2);			FrameRect(&iRect);			return FALSE;		default:			return FALSE;	}}/*******************************************************************************	ShowModeless	If we havenÕt already done so, create the modeless dialog.

After the dialog is created, we set the string	that indicates what weÕre doing. Once all thatÕs done, we show the window	and bring it to the front. Finally, we initialize our progress indicator	routines, and set a global flag telling a routine elsewhere in this file	(DoMainLoopTasks) that it should get off its duff and start doing what we	pay it for.*******************************************************************************/void	StartMovable(void){	short	iType;	Handle	iHandle;	Rect	iRect;	Str255	theString;	short	itemHit;	if (gMovableModalDialog == NIL) {		gMovableModalDialog = GetNewDialog(kMovableModalDialog, NIL, (WindowPtr) -1);		GetIndString(theString, kDialogStrings, kErasingDisk);		GetDItem(gMovableModalDialog, kMMText, &iType, &iHandle, &iRect);		SetIText(iHandle, theString);	}	ShowWindow(gMovableModalDialog);	SelectWindow(gMovableModalDialog);	SetPort(gMovableModalDialog);	GetDItem(gMovableModalDialog, kMMProgressBar, &iType, &iHandle, &iRect);	InitProgressIndicator(gMovableModalDialog, iRect, 500);	gPeriodicTask = TRUE;	gInModalState = TRUE;	AdjustMenus();}/*******************************************************************************	Utility dialog routines*******************************************************************************//*******************************************************************************	FlashDialogItem	Utility to quickly flash a button in the dialog. We highlight the button	by calling HiliteControl, waiting a little bit so that the user can see	the button highlighted, and then turning off the button by calling	HiliteControl again.	This routine assumes that the item we want to flash is backed up by a	Control Manager control, and really works best if the item is a simple	button control.*******************************************************************************/void	FlashDialogItem(DialogPtr dlg, short itemToFlash){	short	iKind;	Handle	iHandle;	Rect	iRect;	long	ignored;	GetDItem(dlg, itemToFlash, &iKind, &iHandle, &iRect);	HiliteControl((ControlHandle) iHandle, 1);	Delay(8, &ignored);	HiliteControl((ControlHandle) iHandle, 0);}/*******************************************************************************	SetDialogItemState	Utility to set the selected state of a dialog item.

We take a	look at the item we are requested to set and compare it with the item that	is currently set. If they are the same, we donÕt need to do anything.	However, if they are different, we turn off the old one, and then turn on	the new one. We also remember which item we just turned on so that we can	refer to it the next time this routine is called.	If the number identifying the currently selected button is zero, we	interpret that to be a magic number meaning that _no_ radio buttons are	currently selected. If thatÕs the case, there are no buttons to be turned	off, and we just turn on the new button.	This routine is very simple in that it supports just a single family of	buttons. In other words, _all_ radio buttons in the dialog are connected	together; turning on any single button with turn off any other button in	the dialog. If you want to support multiple families of radio buttons, you	will have to do a little more work.*******************************************************************************/void	SetRadioButton(DialogPtr dlg, short buttonNumber){	if (buttonNumber != gCurrentRadio) {		if (gCurrentRadio != 0)			SetDialogItemState(dlg, gCurrentRadio, 0);		gCurrentRadio = buttonNumber;		if ((gCurrentRadio >= kFirstRadio) && (gCurrentRadio <= kLastRadio))			SetDialogItemState(dlg, gCurrentRadio, 1);	}}/*******************************************************************************	ToggleCheckBox	Simple utility to toggle the setting of a checkbox item in a dialog box.	We get the old setting, take a look at it so that we know what to change	it into, and then call a utility routine that sets a dialog item to an	absolute value.*******************************************************************************/void	ToggleCheckBox(DialogPtr dlg, short buttonNumber){	short newState;	if (GetDialogItemState(dlg, buttonNumber) == 0)		newState = 1;	else		newState = 0;	SetDialogItemState(dlg, buttonNumber, newState);}/*******************************************************************************	SetDialogItemTitle	Change the text associated with a particular dialog item. This is a little	tricky since there are two ways to change the text. If you are dealing	with an EditText or StatText (static text) item, you must call SetIText.	If you are dealing with a dialog item that is backed up by a Control	Manager control (like a simple button, radio button, or checkbox), you	must call SetCTitle.	We determine what kind of dialog item we are dealing with by calling	GetDItem. Returned in the ÒkindÓ parameter is a number that identifies	what sort of item we are handling. First, we strip off the upper bit,	which identifies the item as being enabled or disabled. Once that bit is	removed, we can examine the kind of the item and act accordingly.	Notice the special handling we give to controls when we call SetCTitle.	This is to take care of Òexcessive flashingÓ as Online Companion puts it.	When you call SetCTitle, the control manager first calls HideControl to	remove the control with its old text from the screen. It then changes the	controlÕs title in the ControlRecord, and reshows the control by calling	ShowControl. At this point, the control is properly shown on the screen	with its correct, new title.	However, thereÕs a little time bomb lurking in the works. When HideControl	was called, the Control Manager called InvalRect on the area the control	occupied. Even though ShowControl was later called on the same area and	everything is drawn correctly, that rectangle is still marked as invalid	and is incorporated into the update region for the dialog. The event loop	at the heart of ModalDialog will then get an update event for that area	and redraw the button _again_! This can cause the button to flicker and	flash more than we would like. We already know that that area is	adequately drawn, so we tell the Event Manager to hoof it by validating it	with a call to ValidRect.*******************************************************************************/void	SetDialogItemTitle(DialogPtr dlg, short item, Str255 *newTitle){	short	iKind;	Handle	iHandle;	Rect	iRect;	GetDItem(dlg, item, &iKind, &iHandle, &iRect);	iKind &= ~itemDisable;				// Strip off the enable/disable bit	if ((iKind == statText) || (iKind == editText)) {		SetIText(iHandle, *newTitle);	} else {		SetCTitle((ControlHandle) iHandle, *newTitle);		SetPort(dlg);		ValidRect(&iRect);	}}/*******************************************************************************	FlipItems	This routine changes the text associated with dialog  items. Basically, we	allow the items to have two states: the flipped on state and the flipped	off state (sometimes called the Òbeing given the birdÓ state). The state	the we want the items to be in is passed in the ÒflippedOnÓ parameter.	We decide which items to change and how to change them by using a couple	of ÔSTR#Õ resources. Each of these resources contains one string for each	of the items in the dialog box. The first ÔSTR#Õ resource contains the	strings for the items when they are in the off state. The other ÔSTR#Õ	contains the strings that get shown when the items are in the on state.	It doesnÕt make sense to change the text of all items. For example, the	icon doesnÕt have any text to change. Also, the OK has only one state. To	handle items that donÕt change, we enter zero-length strings in their	place in the ÔSTR#Õ resource. When we come to one of those strings, we	just skip over that item.	Once weÕve changed the text of all the affected items, we make a note of	the state weÕve left them in. This way, if we call this routine to put the	items into State A, and theyÕre already in State A, there is nothing to	do, and we just skip out of the function.	By the way, take a look at how we determine how many strings there are in	the ÔSTR#Õ resources. The format of a ÔSTR#Õ resource is as follows:		short		n=number of strings in resource		x1 bytes	String #1		x2 bytes	String #2		x3 bytes	String #3		...			...		xn bytes	String #n	To find the number of strings in the resource, we coerce the handle to the	resource into a pointer to a short and fetch the number. Once we have	that, we can make that many calls to GetIndString to read all the strings	one at a time.	Notice that we make a big assumption about the relationship between the	two ÔSTR#Õ resources and the number of items in the dialog. In our	example, we have 26 items in the dialog and 26 strings in each ÔSTR#Õ	resources. If any of these conditions changes, we might be in trouble.	However, you can never protect against _everything_ a user armed with	ResEdit may do, so we take our chances and assume everything is the way we	designed it to be.*******************************************************************************/void	FlipItems(DialogPtr dlg, Boolean flippedOn){	short	loopy;	short	numberOfStrings;	short	resourceNumber;	Handle	strHandle;	Str255	stringMeAlong;		if (flippedOn != gCurrentFlippedState) {		if (flippedOn)			resourceNumber = kFlippedStrings;		else			resourceNumber = kSourceStrings;		strHandle = GetResource('STR#', resourceNumber);		numberOfStrings = **(short **) strHandle;		for (loopy = 1 ; loopy <= numberOfStrings ; ++loopy) {			GetIndString(stringMeAlong, resourceNumber, loopy);			if (stringMeAlong[0] != 0) {				SetDialogItemTitle(dlg, loopy, &stringMeAlong);			}		}	}	gCurrentFlippedState = flippedOn;}/*******************************************************************************	cstrlen	Return the length of a C-string (a series of characters terminated by a	NULL.
