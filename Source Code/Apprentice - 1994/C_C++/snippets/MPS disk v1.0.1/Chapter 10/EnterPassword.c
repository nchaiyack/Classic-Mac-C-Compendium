/*******************************************************************************

	PasswordProc

	ModalDialog filter procedure. This procedure does three things:

	¥ Creates a private TextEdit record if one has not been created already.
	¥ Checks for Return and Enter keypresses to support the standard
	  Modal Dialog interface.
	¥ Supports the masking of all other printable keypresses, turning
	  them into bullets so that the user canÕt see what was really typed.

	HereÕs the general idea behind getting a hidden password from the user:
	What you want to do is catch all keystrokes as the user makes them, stash
	them off someplace, and substitute a masking character (such as a Ò¥Ó)
	that appears on the screen.

	ModalDialog passes all events to the dialog filter as it gets them, so
	that part is easy. We get the key that was pressed and examine it. If itÕs
	Return or Enter, we tell the Dialog Manager that itÕs time for ModalDialog
	to return to the caller.

	If itÕs any other non-printing character, we pass it on to the Dialog
	Manager unchanged. This is so we donÕt do anything foolish like changing
	the cursor keys into bullets.

	We store any printable characters in a parallel TERecord. This is handy
	because it lets us simply call TEKey to insert the character along with
	any previous characters the user has typed. Before we call TEKey, though,
	we synchronize the selection range of our private TERecord with the one
	the Dialog Manager is using. This way, if the user uses the mouse to
	select some or all of the bullets on the screen, we reflect the same
	selection in our private TERecord. Then, when we call TEKey, the selected
	characters in our private TERecord get replaced with the one just pressed.

	For the purposes of this sample, we also show the password on the screen.
	We do this by copying the text out of the Dialog ManagerÕs TERecord and
	inserting it into a static text item in the dialog.
