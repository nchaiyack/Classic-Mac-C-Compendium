	This routine gets called when the user clicks in the zoom box of a window.
	It�s our own special ZoomWindow procedure that zooms the window to the

	DoZoomWindow works by getting three pertinent rectangles: the bounds of
	the monitor the window is on, the bounds of the window�s frame (its
	structure), and the bounds of the window�s content area. Using these
	rectangles, we calculate the where we want the content rectangle of the

	structure that the default WDEF maintains that helps it zoom windows in
	and out. Once all that is done, we call ZoomWindow. ZoomWindow will zoom
	the window to the size and location we just calculated.

	Note that in these days of the �90�s, there is another step that you might
	want to take if you want your application to get all those Ooh�s and Aah�s
	from the customers. With monitors getting larger and larger, it�s a good
	idea to zoom your window to be only as large as it needs to be. For
	instance, if the user zooms a word processing document on a 19 inch
	monitor, it would be nice to zoom the window�s width out to 8.5 inches
	rather than the full 13 inches. We don�t do this here, but it�s something

//	the specified window should be in and its position within that diagonal.
//	Then it determines the horizontal position for the window; as each window
//	is always moved to the right from the previous window by a constant
//	amount, the horizontal position is a simple function of the window�s

//	subtracting an amount that is a function of the diagonal number we are
//	working on. First, we subtract an amount such that the right edge of each
//	window in this diagonal will line up with the corresponding window in the
//	previous diagonal. Next, we add back 10 pixels just to give a nice
//	staggering effect on the right hand side as well as the left. After doing
//	that, we work on figuring the height of the window. We start off with the
//	standard height calculated in StackSetup. Then we subtract a multiple of
//	10 pixels that is based on how far down in the diagonal the window is.

	rectangle, not the outer frame rectangle.

	What we do to accomplish this is to take the frame rectangle passed into
	this routine and calculate what the content rectangle would be for a
	window that had that frame�s size. This is done by looking at the
	window�s current strucRgn (the region that describes the window�s frame)
	and contRgn (the region that describes the inside content area of the
	window). The difference in size between these two regions is determined,
	and is then applied to �newBounds�. This gives us a rectangle that can be
	passed to MoveWindow and SizeWindow.

	Note that we first hide the window before changing its bounds. This is so
	that we don�t first see the effect of MoveWindow, and then the effect of
	SizeWindow.

	rectangle of the structure region. If the window is invisible, the
	strucRgn is not valid. To make it valid, the window has to be moved way
	off the screen and then made visible. This generates a valid strucRgn,
	although it is valid for the position that is way off the screen. It still
	needs to be offset back into the original position. Once the bounding
	rectangle for the strucRgn is obtained, the window can then be hidden
	again and moved back to its correct location. Note that ShowHide is used,
	instead of ShowWindow and HideWindow. HideWindow can change the plane of
	the window. Also, ShowHide does not affect the hiliting of windows.
