First, it determines which diagonal//	the specified window should be in and its position within that diagonal.//	Then it determines the horizontal position for the window; as each window//	is always moved to the right from the previous window by a constant//	amount, the horizontal position is a simple function of the windowÕs//	creation rank. Next, we determine the vertical position of the window.//	This, too, is a simple function, this time of the windowÕs position in the//	diagonal it will be placed in.
