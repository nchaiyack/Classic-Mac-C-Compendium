	ZoomRect

	Draws a series of rectangles that give the appearance of a source rectangle
	being transformed into a destination rectangle. Drawing takes place in a
	GrafPort that covers all monitors.

	The basic idea is this: a transformation in progress can be said to be
	partially complete. The amount by which the transformation is complete can
	be expressed as a percentage. Given this percentage, we can calculate the
	rectangle that needs to be drawn. For example, if we were animating the
	transformation of rectangle (0, 0, 32, 32) into (40, 4, 300, 500),
	then rectangle drawn at the 50% point would be (20, 2, 166, 266).

	Using mathematical formulas determined by the mode parameter, 12
	intermediate percentages are determined, and the rectangles corresponding
	to these percentages are generated. These 12 rectangles are then drawn
	four at a time. First, rectangles 1, 2, 3, and 4 are drawn. Then,
	rectangle 1 is erased and rectangle 5 is drawn. This process continues
	until all 12 rectangles have had their turn.

	The caller can choose one of three different formulas to determine the
	percentages used to generate the rectangles.

		kZoomOut -	This effect can be used for zooming a small rectangle into
					a larger one. Each percentage is 7/5 as large as the
					previous percentage. The final generated value is 100%.
					This gives the effect of starting out slowly and finishing
					up quickly. It can also be percieved as seeing a rectangle
					move forward from a far distance.

		kZoomIn  -	This effect can be used for zooming a large rectangle into
					a smaller one. Each percentage is 5/7 as large as the
					previous percentage. The first value generated is 100%,
					and subsequent values are smaller. Because the values are
					generated backwards from the way we’d like them, we also
					swap the source and destination rectangles to get the
					desired effect, which is to start out quickly, and finish
					up slowly. It can also be percieved as a rectangle moving
					off into the distance.

		kLinear  -	This effect can be used for moving a rectangle from one
					place to another without changing its size. Each percentage
					is evenly spaced from 0% to 100%. This gives a nice even,
					measured effect. It gives the impression of a rectangle
					moving in a single plane, rather than moving into the
					distance or vice-versa.
