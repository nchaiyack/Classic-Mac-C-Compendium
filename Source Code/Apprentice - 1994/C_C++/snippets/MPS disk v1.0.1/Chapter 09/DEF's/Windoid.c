/*******************************************************************************

	DoDraw

	The function that does all of the drawing. What we draw depends on the
	value of “param”, which is passed to us by the Window Manager. If param is
	zero, we draw the entire frame in its standard state. If param is
	wInGoAway, wInZoomIn or wInZoomOut, we have to toggle the state of those
	boxes. We don’t have a zoom box in our window, so we don’t respond to
	wInZoomIn or wInZoomOut.

	Our drawing is done through the System 7.0 DeviceLoop() function. This
	function calls a drawing routine for each set of graphics devices that
	have different drawing characteristics. For instance, if we we’re running
	on a Mac with two monitors, one in 1 bit mode and the other in 8 bit mode,
	our drawing routine is called once for each device. On the other hand, if
	both monitors are both in 8 bit mode and are also identical in every other
	way, our drawing routine is called only once.

	DoHit

	Given the point passed to us in param, determine what part of the window
	was hit. The only values we return here are wInContent, wInGoAway,
	wInDrag, and wNoHit.

	Take special note of the way we check to see if the user clicked in the
	close box or not. We only check to see if the window has its goAwayFlag
	set or not before we check the mouse click location. In most WDEFs, you’d
	also have to check to see if the window is active or not by checking the
	window’s hilited flag. However, we don’t do so here because this WDEF is
	for floating windows. These windows have a special flavor of always
	acting and looking active. For this reason, we allow clicks on the close
	box even if the window is not the frontmost.

	DoCalcRgns

	Calculate the content and structure regions for our window. When we are
	called, the window’s contRgn and strucRgn fields have already been
	initialized with handles to empty regions. All we have to do is fill in
	the regions with the appropriate data.

	This is easy. For the content region, we just get the content rectangle
	and call QuickDraw’s RectRgn() routine on it. The structure region is a
	little trickier because of the shadow. What we do is get the rectangle for
	the frame, but not including the shadow. We turn that into a region and
	save it. We then take the rectangle we just used and offset it down and to
	the right a single pixel. Again, we turn that rectangle into a region. The
	final step involves merging those two regions together with a call to
	UnionRgn().

/*******************************************************************************

	DoDrawAll

	This function is responsible for drawing the entire frame in its standard
	state. Since our window is not very complicated, there isn’t much to do.

	First, we draw the outline of the window. This is quickly done with a
	FrameRect and a few MoveTo’s and LineTo’s.

	Next comes the tricky part: the drawing of dotted pattern in the drag
	area. The problem here is that we are drawing in the Window Manager’s
	port, which is in global coordinates. This means that any patterns drawn
	will be aligned to the global origin. However, when drawing the pattern in
	the drag area, we want the pattern to be aligned to the window’s origin,
	not the global origin.

	Here’s an example to show the problem. Assume that when we first draw the
	window, the drag area looks like this:

	+---------------------------------------------------+
	| * +-+ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * |
	| * +-+ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * |
	+---------------------------------------------------+
	|                                                   |
	|/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/|

	However, the drag area of a window drawn just one pixel over to the right
	would look like this:

	 +---------------------------------------------------+
	 |* *+-+* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *|
	 |* *+-+* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *|
	 +---------------------------------------------------+
	 |                                                   |
	 |/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/|

	See the difference? In the first window, the dotted pattern leaves a white
	one pixel border on the left and right side of the drag area. In the
	second window, the dots are drawn right next to the edges of the drag
	area.

	To take care of this problem, we have to alter our pattern based on our
	window’s location. This is the same thing that QuickDraw does when it
	draws patterns in the content area of your window. Once the pattern is
	determined, we draw the drag area with a call to FillRect().

	Finally, we call a subroutine to draw the GoAway box.

	Note that, if our WDEF supported different appearances depending on the
	hilited state of the window, we would have to check for that here and draw
	accordingly. We can do this check by looking at the “hilited” field of the
	window record.
