/*******************************************************************************	Generic LDEF	This short code segment is the front end for an LDEF. Normally, LDEFs are	standalone pieces of code developed separately from the rest of the	application. While this is not really a bad idea, there are several	disadvantages with it:	- You don’t have access to your application’s global variables. Your	  compiled code can only access a common set of global variables if all	  the parts are linked at the same time. Since the LDEF is linked	  separately from the application, your won’t be able to access the	  application’s globals. On the other hand, some would say that a module	  such as an LDEF should be independent of an application’s	  implementation. If so, then an LDEF shouldn’t need to access the	  application’s variables.	- If you program in a THINK development system and are developing your	  LDEF and application in parallel, you will have to continually jump back	  and forth between projects. You will also have to continually make sure	  your LDEF is incorporated into the right resource file.	- Source level debugging is more difficult under MPW, and impossible	  under THINK.	To solve these problems, we use a front end for the code used to display	the list. All this LDEF does is call the _real_ code back in the	application. When the list record is created, the application will be	expected to store the address of the real code in the list record’s refCon	field. Our front end will fetch that address and jump to it.	The disadvantage of this approach is that the application is not able to	set the refCon before the List Manager calls the LDEF with the LInitMsg.	This means that any initialization normally be done at that time will have	to be done later. In our sample application, we show how to do that.	Note that when we call the real code in the application, we duplicate the	parameters passed in to us. This isn’t wrong or bad or anything. But it	_is_ inefficient. Ideally, we would like to just jump to the real routine,	letting it use the same parameters passed to us. If we were writing in	assembly, this would be simple to do. However, when writing in C, we have	to deal with some of the little “extras” a high level language gives us.	Although THINK C has an inline assembly and we could generate the	instructions to jump to the application code, we have to contend with any	LINK statements or register saving instructions the compiler generates for	our routine. These alter the stack pointer and would have to be	compensated for before jumping back into the application. By examining the	output of the compiler, we could do this. In fact, early versions of this	LDEF _did_ do this. However, this approach is highly dependent on the	compiler you are using. Since, in the Galactic Order of Things, we don’t	really gain a whole lot by doing a JMP back into the application, we opted	for compatibility and easy maintenance instead. The result is that we end	up with a 64 bytes routine instead of a 30 byte routine. Big deal.*******************************************************************************/typedef pascal void (*LDEFProc)(short lMessage, Boolean lSelect, Rect* lRect,								Cell lCell, short lDataOffset, short lDataLen,								ListHandle lHandle);pascal void main(short lMessage, Boolean lSelect, Rect* lRect, Cell lCell,				 short lDataOffset, short lDataLen, ListHandle lHandle){	long	refCon;	refCon = (**lHandle).refCon;	if (refCon != 0L) {		((LDEFProc) refCon) (lMessage, lSelect, lRect, lCell,								lDataOffset, lDataLen, lHandle);	}}
