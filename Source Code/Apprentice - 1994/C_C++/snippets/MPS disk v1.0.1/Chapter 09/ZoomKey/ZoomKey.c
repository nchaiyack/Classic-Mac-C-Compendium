Under THINK C, the compiler adds a little	snippet of code at the beginning of the INIT that jumps to main(), which	means that main() can appear anywhere in the source. Under MPW, this isnÕt	done for you, so you have to make sure that main() is the first procedure	in your source code. 	In order for INITs to stay resident, they must be loaded into the System	heap. Because they contain executable instructions that can be called at	any time, the INIT resource should be locked. Since theyÕll remain locked	during the entire time the computer is on, they should be loaded as low in	the heap as possible to prevent fragmentation. Setting the resSysHeap and	resLocked bits of our INIT resource will do this for us. However, none of	this prevents our INIT resource from being removed from memory as soon as	the file itÕs in is closed. Therefore, the first thing our main() routine	does detach the INIT from the resource file. 	Next, we plug ourselves into the MenuKey() routine. This is done in two	steps. First, we get the address of the current MenuKey() routine and save	it. Then we install the address of our own custom routine. *******************************************************************************/void	main(){	Ptr	ourAddress;	RememberA0();	SetUpA4();	asm {		move.l	A0, ourAddress		; A0 points to the beginning of the									; INIT, courtesy of the THINK glue		}	DetachResource(RecoverHandle(ourAddress));	oldMenuKeyAddress = (MenuKeyProc) GetToolTrapAddress(_MenuKey);	SetToolTrapAddress((long) MyMenuKey, _MenuKey);	RestoreA4();}/*******************************************************************************	MyMenuKey	This the patch that gets called whenever any application calls MenuKey.	What we want to do here is detect whenever the user presses Command-Space.	When they do, we zoom the frontmost window. 	Under the THINK environments, you are allowed to have global variables in	standalone code as long as you call SetUpA4() first. Since weÕve stored	the address of the original MenuKey routine in a global, the first we do	is call SetUpA4(). Then we call the original MenuKey so that it can do its	processing. 	Next, itÕs time for our custom code to step in. When MenuKey returns, we	check for 3 conditions: 1) that the user pressed Command-Space, 2) that	Command-Space doesnÕt correspond to anything in the current applicationÕs	menus, and 3) that there is a front window. If we pass this battery of	tests, we much check to see if that front window can be zoomed.	Unfortunately, there isnÕt really a good way of doing this. While you can	get zoomable windows by specifying a wDefProcID of 8 or 12, this is just a	convention for the standard system WDEF. ThereÕs no guarantee that WDEFs	written by Worldwide Washington WindowsWare will use the same convention.	Also, checking the window to see if its procID is 8 or 12 will fail if	Apple defines proc IDs 9-11 to produce zoomable windows as well. On the	other hand, they could equally as well define proc IDs 9-11 to produce	non-zoomable windows as well. Another solution is needed. 	The one weÕve chosen here is to call FindWindow on the location where we	expect the zoom box to be. Obviously, this will fail if the WDEF	programmer puts the zoom box in a different place, but it should at least	work for all of AppleÕs WDEF designs. 	If FindWindow returns inZoomIn or inZoomOut, we know that the window has a	zoom box. All that remains to do is to zoom the window. Initially, you	might think that a simple call to ZoomWindow will do the trick.	Unfortunately, this is not so. Zooming a window involves more than just	calling ZoomWindow. For instance, if there are any scroll bars in the	window, they must be moved. No, a better solution is to fake a mouse click	on the same spot that we used to test for a zoombox. *******************************************************************************/pascal long MyMenuKey(short ch){	long		result;	WindowPtr	theWindow;	Rect		*rectPtr;	Point		location;	short		part;	EvQElPtr	qElPtr;	SetUpA4();	result = oldMenuKeyAddress(ch);	if ( ((char) ch == ' ')							// If Command-Space ...	  && (result == 0)								// ... and not in menus ...	  && ((theWindow = FrontWindow()) != nil)) {	// ... and has front window ...	 	rectPtr = &((**(((WindowPeek)theWindow)->strucRgn)).rgnBBox);	 	location.h = rectPtr->right - 15;	 	location.v = rectPtr->top + 10;		part = FindWindow(location, &theWindow);		if ((part == inZoomIn) || (part == inZoomOut)) {	// ... and it zooms.		 	/*		 		=== Bad way ===		 		GetPort(&oldPort);		 		SetPort(theWindow);		 		ZoomWindow(theWindow, part, TRUE);		 		SetPort(oldPort);		 	*/			PPostEvent(mouseDown, 0, &qElPtr);			qElPtr->evtQWhere = location;			PPostEvent(mouseUp, 0, &qElPtr);			qElPtr->evtQWhere = location;		}	}	RestoreA4();	return result;}
