/*******************************************************************************

	TrackMouse

	Generic mouse tracking routine. This is a stripped down version of MacAppÕs
	own core tracking routine. The main difference in our version is that we
	donÕt support automatic scrolling of the window if the mouse moves beyond
	its bounds.

	TrackMouse is called with the addresses of three callback routines. The
	first callback is the Constrain callback. This function is called to
	perform any constraining or gridding of the mouse location. It is called
	with the current location of the mouse, and is expected to  return a
	modified location. Note that the cursor itself is NOT  constrained (i.e.,
	the mouse doesnÕt jump from grid point to grid point like it does when
	moving a HyperCard window horizontally).

	The second callback routine is the FeedBack routine. This routine is
	called to perform any drawing that indicates to the user that something
	important is going on. For instance, if you wanted to sketch a rectangle
	in the window like you can in the Finder, you would provide a FeedBack
	routine that would draw the rectangle. Note that this routine is called
	both to draw the feedback and to erase it later.

	The third callback is the Track routine. This callback is used to perform
	any other processing that needs to be done in the main tracking loop. For
	instance, something like the Finder could use this routine to highlight
	any icons that are within the currently sketched rectangle.

	The basic algorithm of the routine is thus:

		 1.	The initial mouse location (the anchor point) is determined
			and constrained.
		 2.	The Track routine is called with a message indicating that
			tracking is about to start.
		 3.	The FeedBack routine is called to draw the initial feedback.
		 4.	The next mouse location is determined and constrained.
		 5.	We determine if the mouse moved since the last time we
			looked at it. Later, a Boolean indicating whether or not the
			mouse moved will be passed to the Track and Feedback routines
			to help them decide what to do.
		 6.	Delay a single tick. This is to give the last drawn feedback
			a chance to show up on the screen.
		 7.	Call the FeedBack routine to erase the previous feedback.
		 8.	Call the Track routine to allow it to do any other processing.
		 9.	Call the FeedBack routine again to draw the new feedback.
		10.	Repeat steps 4-9 until the mouse button is lifted.
		11.	Call the FeedBack routine to erase the final feedback.
		12.	Call the Track routine, telling it that tracking is complete.

	AdjustForTrackingFromCenter

	Handy routine that adjusts the anchor point if we want Òtrack from centerÓ
	tracking. Tracking from the center means that we would like the initial
	mouse down location to be the center of whatever shape we are sketching.
	For example, if we had a routine that sketched out an circle, we might
	want to have the initial mouse location be the circle origin and the
	current mouse location determine its radius.

	This routine will take the initial and final mouse locations, and convert
	the initial mouse location such that the two points will describe the
	bounding box of the circle, roundRect, or whatever.
