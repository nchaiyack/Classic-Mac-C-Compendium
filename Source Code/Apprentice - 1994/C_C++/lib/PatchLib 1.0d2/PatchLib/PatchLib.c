/* See the file Distribution for distribution terms.	(c) Copyright 1994 Ari Halberstadt *//*	¤Patch Library	Patch Library is used to manage patches to traps. Installing and removing	patches is simpler than using the Toolbox routines NSetTrapAddress and	NGetTrapAddress. In addition, macros are provided that setup and restore	the environment for the patch routine. C source code is provided. *//*	Revision History:	94/04/18 aih -	Added some more comments and made it a stand-alone library	94/03/02 aih -	Removed almost all of the assembly language glue since it:						wasn't really needed; was overly complex; and wouldn't						compile in native PowerPC mode. Now there's just a small						bit of assembly language glue in a couple of macros.		94/02/03 aih -	removed ExitToShell patch since it isn't needed if the						application just calls PatchEndAll before exiting and						the fewer patches we install the better		93/12/22 aih -	uses NewPtrClear/DisposPtr instead of calling MemoryLib						functions, so that we don't need to depend on or intialize						MemoryLib	93/11/22 aih -	totally rewrote so it no longer uses a self-modifying						code resource to save the original address of the trap,						instead the code and data about a patch are stored in a						non-relocatable block	93/11/20 aih -	modified so patch can prevent execution of original trap	93/03/26 AIH -	Changed PatchType to void* instead of pointer to function						returning void.	91/05/15 AIH -	Added a few comments	91/04/19 AIH -	The trap type is determined at run-time, so there's no						need to pass the trap type as a parameter to the patch						install function.	91/03/23 AIH -	StripAddress is called before calling NSetTrapAddress.						This probably is not needed, but TN#213 recommends calling						StripAddress before patching traps (ok, only for traps						that start at a block, if I read it correctly), but the						issue is so confusing it seems simplest just to call						StripAddress.	91/02/28 aih -	Added default definitions for parameter declarations	91/01/18 aih -	Wrote this generic patch handling function/macro						combination. */#include <Memory.h>#include "PatchLib.h"/* list of patches */static PatchType gPatches;/*	GetTrapType returns the type of the trap (ToolBox or Operating System). */static TrapType GetTrapType(short trap){	return((trap & 0x0800) > 0 ?
