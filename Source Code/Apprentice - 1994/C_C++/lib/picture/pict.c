You should define a single*	object of a class descending from Generic_Pict in your application,*	and your main() function should simply send this object a run()*	message.**   REVISED:         November 7, 1991*   AUTHOR:          Donald C. Snow*   CHANGES:**	eliminated the one instance of conditional compilation in *	the code by having all derived screen header files define *	"SCREEN" to something appropraite. Thus, new SCREEN, as *	opposed to, conditionally, new Mac_Screen or *	new PC_Screen. */# include	"pict.h"# include	"error.h"#ifdef THINK_C#include "macscrn.h"#endif#ifdef TURBO_C#include "pcscrn.h"#endif#ifdef __GNUG__#include "xscrn.h"#endifError	*gerror;		// global to report errors// # include	<stdio.h>	// to allow stdio in pict application/*******************************************************************	initialize******************************************************************/Generic_Pict::Generic_Pict(void){	double	aspect;//	printf("\n");	// activate Think C console first to enable stdio	gerror = new Error;	screen = new SCREEN;//	screen constructor should do this, but just to be sure: 	aspect = screen->get_device_aspect_ratio();	screen->set_normalized_frame(0.,0.,2.,2./aspect); 	backdrop = new Backdrop_Projector;	backdrop->set_screen(screen); }/*******************************************************************	run - override freely*	If stdio is enabled as mentioned above, then the graphics*	windows are supplemented with a console for text i/o.
