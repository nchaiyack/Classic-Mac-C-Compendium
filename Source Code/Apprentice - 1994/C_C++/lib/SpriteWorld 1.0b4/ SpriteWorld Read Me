//					SpriteWorld Read Me   --  Version 1.0b4  --   4/25/94
///--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the loooong overdue fourth release of SpriteWorld.

This release includes…
    •  Full native PowerPC support.
    •  Native PowerPC custom blitters (written in C)
    •  Improvements & optimizations to the 68k pixel blitting routines
        resulting in 25% faster frame rates than the previous version.
    •  A so called "mask compiler" that will generate 68k machine code to draw  
        a specific sprite's images resulting in an additional 15% frame rate 
        boost over BlitPixie.  (4, 8 bit per pixel, 48x48 sprites bouncing around at
        410 frames for second on a Quadra 800)
    •  Support for more compilers such as THINK C 5, 6, & 7, MetroWerks C,
        MPW C, and even GCC.
    •  Improvements to the core animation engine to improve the frame rate,
        and to lower the processing overhead associated with idle sprites
    •  Several bug fixes, and a few minor API changes.
    •  and some additional odd & ends. 

Refer to the release notes for a more detailed change history.

Many thanks again to all of the folks that have been giving me great feedback on SpriteWorld over the months (years?) since its first release.

Due to time constraints not much testing went into this one. Be sure and let me know of any problems that you encounter.

Yeah, but what is it?

SpriteWorld is a sprite-based animation architecture for the Macintosh. SpriteWorld comes as a set of code libraries and interfaces that provide a simple, but deep programming interface for implementing smooth, fast, animation in your applications. In the interest of openness and learning, the full source code to the SpriteWorld libraries and sample applications is provided. SpriteWorld was designed for arcade game style animation in particular with full support for multi-frame, overlapping, animated  sprites, and custom pixel-blitting routines.

///--------------------------------------------------------------------

The color textures used in the SpriteWord sample programs are from the Desktop Textures 2.0: Textures Volume II package by Geoff Adams & Stephen Krauth. Embarassingly enough I hadn't realized the origins of these textures before the authors contacted me and let me know, at the same time giving me compliments on SpriteWorld and permission to continue using their textures.

The only thing I ask for in exchange for SpriteWorld, is a free copy (that is make me a fully paid, registered user) of any cool game that you write with SpriteWorld.
