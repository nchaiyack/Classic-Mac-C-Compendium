The basic idea is that	the meter "bezel" has an opening 10 X 100 pixels for the indicator.	The indicator is 110 X 100 pixels in size. It is pure white for the top 10	pixels of its height. Below that, it is divided diagonally into red and white	areas. This indicator is scrolled up and down behind the bezel to give a	reading between 0 and 100&.*/Boolean LoadUsageMeterScene(GEWorldPtr world){	GrafElPtr		meterBkg, thisElement;		//Get meter bkg picture	meterBkg = NewBasicPICT(world, meterBkgID, meterPlane, rMeterBkg,								transparent, meterLeft, meterTop);	if (meterBkg == nil) return false;		//Get Indicator picture	thisElement = NewScrollingGraphic(world, meterIndID, indPlane, rMeterInd,								srcCopy, indLeft, indTop);	if (thisElement == nil) return false;		//Show only top 10 pixels of indicator	thisElement->animationRect.bottom = thisElement->animationRect.top + 10;	//Connect indicator to bkg	meterBkg->slaveGrafEl = thisElement;	return true;}pascal void SetMeterReading(GEWorldPtr world, short percent){	if (percent < 0) percent = 0;	if (percent > 100) percent = 100;		SetScroll(world, meterIndID, 0, percent);}
