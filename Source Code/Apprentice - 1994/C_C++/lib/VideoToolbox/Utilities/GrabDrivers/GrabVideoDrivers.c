/*GrabVideoDrivers.cGets each active video driver and saves it in a file of the same name, using thedriver's version number as a resource id. These files can later be examined inResEdit, using the public domain CODE viewer. You'll want to consult Apple'sDesigning Cards and Drivers, 3rd Ed., Addison Wesley.The ResEdit CODE viewer is a public domain file, for use with ResEdit,distributed by:Ira L. RubenApple Computer, Inc.20525 Mariani Ave., MS: 37-ACupertino, Ca. 95014Ira@Apple.ComCopyright restrictions prevent us from distributing video drivers themselves,but this program makes it easy for you to get an accessible copy of all thevideo drivers used in your own computer.The primary users of this program will probably be those who wish to enhanceSetEntriesQuickly.c. I hope that people will share the fruits of their labors bysending me the enhancements for distribution in the VideoToolbox disk.This program is also useful for copying the Mac IIsi video driver to the MacIIci. Since that's a ROM-based driver I don't know any way to automaticallydetermine its size, and instead this program uses a generous guess. Consequentlythe resulting resource is larger than it needs to be. When you install thisresource in the System file of your Mac IIci the excess space is wasted (both ondisk and in memory), but the excess is only about 1 kB, so it doesn't seem worthworrying about.HISTORY:2/89 dgp Wrote it as "video hacker II.c" using THINK "Light Speed" C 3.12/30/92 dgp updated it to THINK C 5 and renamed it GrabVideoDrivers.c*/#include "VideoToolbox.h"#include <Errors.h>#include <Files.h>#include <Resources.h>#define dRAMBased		0x0040Handle GetDriverFromSlotManager(GDHandle device);void main(void);void CopyDeviceDriver(GDHandle device);void AddResourceToFile(unsigned char *filename,unsigned char *name,ResType type	,int id,Handle handle);typedef struct {	short flags;	short blanks[3];	short open;	short prime;	short control;	short status;	short close;	Str255 name;} VideoDriver;VideoDriver *GDDriverAddress(GDHandle device);void main(){	GDHandle device;	int i;		MaximizeConsoleHeight();	printf("Welcome to GrabVideoDriver.\n");	printf("This program cycles through all your video devices and copies\n"	"each driver into a resource file, suitable for subsequent examination\n"	"with ResEdit (with the CODE viewer).
