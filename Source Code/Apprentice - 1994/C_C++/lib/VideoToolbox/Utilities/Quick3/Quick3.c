/*Quick3.c Copyright (c) 1990-1993 Denis G. Pelli Quick3.c is a C program that makes maximum likelihood fits of simple models topsychometric data. This is a replacement for, and to some extent is derived fromthe old QUICK.FOR program written by A.B.Watson. See A.B.Watson (1979)Probability summation over time. Vision Research 19, 515-522.The principal difference between this program and the original QUICK, is in howthe goodness of fit is calculated. Both programs assess the goodness of fit bycomparing the log likelihoods of the model fit (usually Weibull) with a nullhypothesis. Minus two times this log likelihood ratio is approximately chisquare, with a number of degrees of freedom equal to the difference in degreesof freedom of the two hypotheses. QUICK used an unconstrained psychometricfunction, which adopted the actual proportion correct at each contrast. Quick3uses a monotone hypothesis that is constrained to be monotonically increasingas a function of contrast. The virtue of the latter hypothesis is that it iseasier to estimate its degrees of freedom when there are unequal numbers of datapoints at each contrast. (However, this estimate is seat-of-my-pants.) Finally,this program actually computes the significance for you, from the chi squarevalue and the estimate of its degrees of freedom. This significance value is ofsome use in choosing a small fraction of your fits to discard (e.g. ifsignificance is less than 0.05). This significance is misleadingly low when bothhypotheses have nearly the same number of degrees of freedom (i.e. you only havea few contrasts). Looking at the significance is helpful, but not a substitutefor thinking about whether your results are really reasonable.Note that Quick3.c is just a front end, dealing with the user interface andreading and writing files. All the work is done by one call toPsychometricFit(). In many cases it will be convenient to call that routinedirectly from your program that collects (or generates) the data, rather thansaving the data in a file for subsequent analysis by Quick3.c. If you want touse a psychometric model other than the Weibull function all you need to do iswrite a small function to implement it, based on Weibull.c. It should be easy.PsychometricFit() uses whatever psychometric function is supplied in the call.Quick3 reads in your data from a text file and analyzes them. The results areshown on the screen, and are saved in two kinds of output file. The *.fit file isin Excel format and has just a minimal one-line summary for each condition,giving the parameters and goodness of fit. The *.plot file is in text format andis suitable for plotting (e.g. by CricketGraph) of the psychometric data alongwith the Weibull and Monotonic fits. For Macintosh users, the output files areTEXT files, but have the appropriate creator so that double-clicking them opensthe data file in the appropriate application, either Excel or Cricket Graph.For maximum convenience, change the definition of PLOT_CREATOR to match that of your favorite graphing program.You should also have received a CricketGraph format files called "CricketGraphQuick3" (for the original CricketGraph) and "CA-CricketGraphIII Quick3" (for the newCricketGraphIII). Put the appropriate file in the same folder as theCricketGraph application. When CricketGraph starts up it will read in the formatfile, and later you'll be able to select that format from CricketGraph's Formatmenu when you plot your data.Quick3's input file format is simple and flexible. It is a text file. Linesbeginning with "#" are treated as comments. Comments are either copied directlyto the .fit file, or used as a name for the next "condition" (i.e. block ofdata). The file must begin with at least one comment line. The last of severalcontiguous comment lines will be taken to be the name for the followingcondition. All the non-comment lines until the next comment will be interpretedas the data for that condition.An experiment usually consists of several conditions, or blocks of trials.Within the condition the observer will be tested repeatedly at variouscontrasts. The results consist of the number of trials correct at each contrast.The results may be described by a set of "contrast records". Each contrastrecord consists of a contrast (e.g. 0.012), the number of trials at thatcontrast (e.g. 1 or 100), and the number of correct responses (e.g. 0 or 79).Quick3 expects a contrast record to look like this:0.012 100 79The three numbers are all on one line, and separated by white space, so sscanfcan parse them. Anything on the line after the third number is ignored. Allcontrast records until the next comment (line beginning with "#") or the end offile are assumed to be from the same condition and are analyzed together. Thecontrast records may be in any order. The records will be sorted into order ofascending contrast. You may have any number of trials at each contrast, up toabout two billion (i.e. LONG_MAX in limits.h). It's okay to have multiplerecords with equal contrasts. The data will be merged, adding up the trials atthat contrast. You can even be really lazy and just write out each trial as aseparate contrast record, in whatever order, without keeping track of how many,etc.You may add records with zero trials (and zero correct) so as to have fittedvalues computed at those contrasts in the .plot file.Here's an example of a data file, suitable for analysis by Quick3:#This is a sample file. #The first condition is called "monocular" and has 60 trials at 6 contrasts.#monocular0.1 10 40.2 10 50.3 10 70.4 10 6 Anything after the specified data is ignored.0.5 10 80.6 10 10# The "binocular" condition is bigger: 1000 trials.#binocular 0.056     100    53 0.064     100    53 0.073     100    65 0.083     100    77 0.094     100    81 0.107     100    84 0.121     100    96 0.138     100    99 0.156     100   100 0.178     100   100#all doneHere's the resulting .fit file (tabs will space properly in Excel, but not here):Condition	logAlpha	beta	gamma	delta	free params	signif.

Accept only printing characters				in the condition name, ignoring everything after the first non-printing				character. This deals with the fact that if an Excel file is used for				input, there are lots of trailing tabs that should be ignored. Checked				that files were actually open before closing 'em. Jeesh!10/29/90	dgp	tidied up comments.1/20/91		dgp	updated calls to BinomialUpperBound & BinomialUpperBound to				conform to new definition.8/24/91		dgp	Made compatible with THINK C 5.0.11/17/92	dgp Now SetVol() after calling SFGetFile, so that file can be in any folder,				not just the same folder that Quick3 is in.1/19/93		dgp	put #ifs around the Mac-dependent code.2/20/93		dgp	added call to Require().8/5/93		dgp	moved call to Require() into a separate main(), since application				failed on Mac Plus before it got to the call to Require(). Thanks				to Robert Friedman friedman@cortex.health.ufl.edu for reporting the				problem.10/13/93	dgp	added comments about CricketGraphIII. Allow compile-time choice of				Mac file's creator.3/13/94	dgp	replaced MyFGets by standard fgets. Edited the code slightly, making				it a bit more resilient of errors in data file format.*///#define PLOT_CREATOR	'CGRF'	/* Create Macintosh Cricket Graph file */#define PLOT_CREATOR	'CRGR'	/* Create Macintosh CA-Cricket Graph III file */#include "VideoToolbox.h"#include "Quick3.h"#include <nr.h>				/* Numerical Recipes in C*/#include <assert.h>#if MACINTOSH	#include <QuickDraw.h>	#include <StandardFile.h>#endifvoid Quick3(void);void main(void){	#if MACINTOSH		Require(0);	// check for any required cpu and fpu.	#endif	Quick3();}void Quick3(void){	static dataRecord data,monotonicData;	contrastRecord *cPtr;	static paramRecord params, initParams;	double *paramPtr=&params.logAlpha;	/* a generic way of accessing the parameters */	int i;	double chiSquare,modelLL,monotonicLL;	/* log likelihood */	int chiSquareDF,modelDF,monotonicDF;	/* degrees of freedom */	double significance;	FILE *dataFile=NULL,*fitFile=NULL,*plotFile=NULL;	char dataFileName[50],fitFileName[50],plotFileName[50],string[100];	char conditionName[100];	long trials;	unsigned int a;	PsychometricFunctionPtr ModelFunction=&Weibull;	/* a psychometric function */	static const char modelName[]="Weibull";	static const char paramName[PARAMS][16]={"logAlpha","beta","gamma","delta"};	#if MACINTOSH		Point where;		static SFTypeList typeList;		static SFReply reply;		assert(StackSpace()>4000);	#endif	/* initial values for the parameters of the psychometric function */	params.logAlpha=0.0;	params.beta=3.5;	params.gamma=0.5;	params.delta=0.01;	printf("\n");	/* ask THINK C to init QuickDraw */		#if MACINTOSH		where.h=100;		where.v=100;		typeList[0]='TEXT';		reply.version=0;		SFGetFile(where,"\p",NULL,1,typeList,NULL,&reply);		if(!reply.good)PrintfExit("Couldn't open file.\n");		SetVol(NULL,reply.vRefNum);	/* look in that folder */		sprintf(dataFileName,"%#s",reply.fName);	#else		// Insert code here to get data file name into dataFileName.	#endif	dataFile=fopen(dataFileName,"r");	if(dataFile==NULL)		PrintfExit("\007Sorry, can't find file \"%s\".\007\n",dataFileName);	printf("Reading \"%s\"\n",dataFileName);	strcpy(string,dataFileName);	if(strstr(string,".data"))strcpy(strstr(string,".data"),"");	else if(strstr(string,".yes"))strcpy(strstr(string,".yes"),"");	if(strlen(string)>0){		sprintf(fitFileName,"%s.fit",string);		printf("Creating output files:\n%s\n%s.<condition name>.plot\n"			,fitFileName,string);		fitFile=fopen(fitFileName,"w");		if(fitFile==NULL)			PrintfExit("Sorry, I can't create file \"%s\".\007\n",fitFileName);		#if MACINTOSH			SetFileInfo(fitFileName,'TEXT','XCEL');		/* Excel file */		#endif	}	modelDF=PARAMS;	/* number of parameters to be adjusted in fitting */	printf("How many parameters shall be adjustable? 0 to %d (%d):",PARAMS,modelDF);	gets(string);	sscanf(string,"%d",&modelDF);	for(i=1;i<modelDF;i++){		printf("Initial value for %s?
