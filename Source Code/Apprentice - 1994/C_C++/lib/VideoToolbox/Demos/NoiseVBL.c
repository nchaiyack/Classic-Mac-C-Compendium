/*NoiseVBL.cThere are two ways to synchronize your program to a video display. Applerecommends using the vertical blanking level interrupt (VBL). That approach isillustrated here. The other approach, which I normally prefer, is to use a sideeffect of loading the video cards clut: most video drivers don't return untilthe vertical blanking interval. The interrupt approach is more or lessguaranteed to work on all video cards, since Apple more or less requires that itbe supported by all video drivers. Its only disadvantage is that interrupts must be enabled. I have the impression--though I haven't collectedhard data--that interrupts steal a lot of time, depending on how busy AppleTalk,the disk, SCSI, keyboard, mouse, and even miscellaneous INITs that are driven byVBL interrupts. So when I really want to crank, to display movies, I prefer touse SetPriority(7) to temporarily suspend all interrupts. In that case thevideo-driver side effect approach is your only choice. However, be warned thatsome video drivers don't wait, and others take more than a frame to load theclut, so do some careful timing before you rely on it, i.e. run TimeVideo.This program shows a noise movie, a dynamic random checkerboard, at 66.7 Hz! Thekey routine, which shows each frame, is in the file CopyBitsQuickly.c For bestresults you should allocate lots of memory to this program, e.g. 3MB. Itpre-computes as many noise frames as space allows. After showing each frame onceit cycles through them again. Thus to get a true impression of white noise youneed to compute lots of noise frames, e.g. 100. This may require severalmegabytes, depending what your screen's pixel depth is set to.HISTORY:11/23/88 Denis Pelli wrote it.4/20/91 I updated this. It now has essentially no hardware dependencies. It doesrequire that the video be in a slot, since it uses slot interrupts. A basicproblem with the scheme is that interrupts seem to be shut out while theinterrupt service routines are running. As a result the timing information isinaccurate since many 1 ms interrupts are lost during the call toCopyBitsQuickly(). I think the only solution to this would be to put the timeconsuming call to CopyBitsQuickly back in the main program, waiting for theinterrupt service routine to give it permission to start each new frame.4/15/92 Removed all bugs and updated to work with THINK C 5. Now properly set A5in the interrupt service routines, using the method suggested in Tech Note 180.I removed the old attempt to disable AppleTalk, which now seems to hang up whenit attempts to reenable AppleTalk. I also removed the clut manipulations.4/16/92	Put the noise in its own window. Run essentially continuously untiluser quits.8/19/92 Replaced obsolete TimeIt.c by new Timer.c. Timing seems to be fine now.8/22/92 dgp Moved most of the interrupt service routine code to VBLInterruptServiceRoutine.c. Just for fun, I made the program use an alternate monitor,if available. Fixed a small bug that prevented display of noise on an alternatemonitor if it had a different pixelSize than the main screen.9/15/92 dgp Updated to use new Timer.c.2/18/93	dgp	Added fpu test.2/20/93	dgp	Call Require(), increased stack space.7/7/93	dgp replaced call to CopyBitsQuickly by CopyBits, for compatibility withRadius PowerView.3/19/94	dgp updated the call to Shuffle(), adding new required argument.*/#include <VideoToolbox.h>#include <assert.h>#if THINK_C	#include <console.h>#endif/* The user may wish to adjust these.
