VideoToolbox: ChangesApril 25, 1994CHANGES DURING 4/94:베dded THINK C 7 projects and deleted THINK C 5 projects.베dded GetRectDevice() to GetScreenDevice.c.벤nhanced SetPixelsQuickly.c to not flush its cache when writing to the main screen.CHANGES DURING 3/94:베dded ATMInterface.c and ATMInterface.h from Adobe Systems Inc., allowing direct access to Adobe Type Manager for special effects.벨n Normal.c, added BoundedNormalIntegers(distribution,n,mean,sd,min,max), which fills the "distribution" array with n ordered integers so that random samples from the array, i=distribution[nrand(n)], will be samples from a bounded normal distribution.벨n nrand.c, replaced all three routines (nrand, nrandU, and nrandUL) by one universal routine, nrand, that returns an unsigned long value and uses integer arithmetic (as in the old nrandU) if n is small enough, and otherwise uses double arithmetic (as in the old nrandUL).베dded LtoE, EToL, and LtoEOrdered to Luminance.c. LtoE returns the index of the table entry in the specified range with luminance closest to L.벢hanged DateString.c to produce shorter strings by omitting the periods:  "890625015959" instead of "89.06.25.01.59.59".Rewrote Shuffle.c to accept an arbitrary elementSize. (All calling programs will need to be changed, to add the new argument.)벣eleted MyFgets.c from Quick3.베dded CVNetConvert by Izumi Ozhawa to the Utilities folder.베dded IdentifyOwner to Identify.c.베dded MacMemory.h and MacMemory.c which, if included in your project, redefine the Standard C memory management calls (free,malloc,calloc,realloc) to use the Apple Memory Manager, bypassing Symantec THINK C's inefficient memory manager.벤nhanced Assign.c slightly. PrintAnAssignment now prints enough digits to maintain the precision specified in float.h. This resolves the somewhat spurious errors reported by UnequalDescribedVars when doing read-after-write checks. Fixed PrintQuotedString to correctly handle strings containing the double-quote character. Cosmetic enhancement of how /* comments */ are printed, for nicer word wrap.베dded RemovePalette(window) to GDOpenWindow.c, which complements the pre-existing AddExplicitPalette(window).CHANGES DURING 2/94:벤nhanced VBLInstall.c in response to query by Mike Tarr; it now runs forever if frames==-1.벤nhanced StringBounds.c to also count the black pixels. An argument was added.CHANGES DURING 1/94:벤nhanced MultipleChoice.c to keep accepting characters until they uniquely specify an answer.베dded routines to Mean.c to accept arrays of signed or unsigned char, short, or long. All the routines have been optimized for speed.베dded StringBounds.c, which computes the minimum bounding rectangle for all the pixels that would be set black by calling DrawString with the given pascal string, in the current port, font, size, and style. CharBounds creates a one-char string and calls StringBounds().베dded PrintfGWorld.c, for debugging, which uses "printf" to print out the GWorld as a gross bitmap.All earlier changes appear in the file VideoToolbox:"Changes 1990-3".
