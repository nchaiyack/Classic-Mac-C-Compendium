In anticipation of these questions, here is an article (similar tothat which I posted for the earlier Quadra machines) which provides andescription of these video capabilities.  This article discusses a few generalvideo topics, details how to wire the video connector sense pins to access allthe supported video modes of these machines, and describes the memoryconfigurations necessary to support each of the video modes at specific pixeldepths.  (I am the designer of the video hardware for the Quadra700/900/950/800 and the Centris 610/650, you can be reasonably sure thisinformation is accurate.)General Video Design Philosophy--------------------------------------The video hardware design of the Centris 610/650 and the Quadra 800 is highlyderivative from the earlier Quadra machines.  However, one of the main goals ofthese CPUs (and perhaps the #1 goal) was to reduce the cost of the machinesrelative to the Quadra 700 and 950, while still providing the same (or better!)performance.  While it was not possible to significantly reduce cost whilemaintaining the exact feature set of the earlier Quadras, most of the Quadravideo features were carried through to the Centris 610/650 and Quadra 800.  Themain exceptions are support for Apple convolution (flicker reduction) for NTSCand PAL, and support for 24 bits per pixel (bpp).The video hardware for all three CPUs, the Centris 610 (C610), Centris 650(C650) and Quadra 800 (Q800), is virtually identical.  The only exception isthat the C610 only requires 100 ns VRAM, while the C650 and Q800 require 80 nsVRAM.The maximum supported pixel depth is 16 bpp.  This is not a matter of theamount of VRAM in the machine - it is a hardware limitation  The RAM/DAC used by all three machines simply does not include the hardware required to do 24bpp on any display.  The same is true for the lack of support for Appleconvolution - the hardware necessary to do this is not present in the machine. 24 bpp support was dropped for a number of reasons:   1) Cost reduction.  It is still relatively expensive to provide the 24 bppsupport offered by the Q700 and Q950.  It would not have been possible to hitthe price point of the C610 while still offering 24 bpp.  2) Marketing research data has shown that a very large percentage of Quadrausers do not use the onboard video, but rather use an accelerated video cardcapable of driving a 2-page display at 24 bpp.  Since it was not reasonable toburden the price of every C610, C650 and Q800 with the cost of a 2-page 24 bppframe buffer, the 24 bpp feature was dropped altogether (with a net result of asubstantial decrease in cost).  3) 16 bpp offers most of the advantages of 24 bpp, without much of the costand at a higher level of performance.   QuickTime MooV playback is optimizedfor 16 bpp.  Also, for casual browsing of image data (e.g., scanned images orPhotoCD pictures) 16 bpp is quite adequate and offers better performance withfewer system resource requirements than 24 bpp.Convolution support was dropped primarily for cost reasons, and also because itis very rarely used.  NTSC and PAL timing support are still offered, however. The C610, C650, and Q800 do support all the monitor types supported by theQ950.  This includes support for a 1024 x 768 resolution on 19-inch displays(which was not provided by the Q700).One area that was positively impacted was performance.  At the same processorclock speed, the video section of these new machines outperforms the videosection of the older Quadras.  (I.e., video performance on the C650 is betterthan the Q700, and on the Q800 is better than the Q950.)  Due to an improvedvideo memory controller design, one wait state was removed from many of theframe buffer access cycles.  This results in reduced memory access timeoverall, and therefore improved performance.  The graphics tests in Speedometer(version 3.11) show an improvement of roughly 6-10% over the earlier Quadramachines (each running System 7.1).Supported Display Configurations and Monitor ID Codes-----------------------------------------------------The Centris/Quadra frame buffer determines what type of display is attached tothe video connector by examining the state of 3 sense line pins.  The followingchart details how these three pins must be wired for each of the supporteddisplay types.  For each supported display, the screen resolution (horiz.pixels  X  vertical pixels), dot clock frequency, and the vertical andhorizontal scan rates are listed.Basically, the Centris 610/650 and Quadra 800 support any display, whether fromApple or from another vendor, that meets one of the following specifications:STANDARD SENSE CODES:                        Sense pins       Hor x Vert    Dot      Vert     HorizDisplay                10   7    4      Pixels        Clock    Refrsh   Refrsh-----------            -----------      ----------    -----    ------   ------ Apple 21" Color        0    0    0     1152 x 870     100        75     68.7Apple Portrait         0    0    1      640 x 870     57.2832    75     68.9 12" Apple RGB          0    1    0      512 x 384     15.6672    60.15  24.48 Apple Two-Page Mono.   0    1    1     1152 x 870     100        75     68.7 NTSC                   1    0    0  underscan-512x384 12.2727    59.94  15.7                       1    0    0  overscan- 640x480 12.2727    59.94  15.7(To produce a color NTSC signal, a RGB-to-NTSC converter is required.)12" AppleMonochrome    1    1    0      640 x 480    30.24      66.7    35.0 13" Apple RGB          1    1    0      640 x 480    30.24      66.7    35.0Extended sense codes will be examined if the following sense code is detected:                       1    1    1 NOTE 1 on above monitors: A sense pin value of 0 means that the pin should begrounded to the C&VSYNC.GND signal; a value of 1 means do not connect the pin. NOTE 2 on above monitors: sense pins 4, 7, and 10 are referred to as SENSE0,SENSE1, and SENSE2 in pinout tables for the video connectors.NOTE 3: The terms 'underscan' and 'overscan' are used to describe the activevideo resolution for NTSC and PAL modes.  Underscan means that the active videoarea appears in a rectangle centered on the screen with a black surroundingarea.  This ensures that the entire active video area always is displayed onall monitors.  Overscan utilizes the entire possible video area for NTSC orPAL.  However, most monitors or televisions will cause some of this video to belost beyond the edges of the display, so the entire image will not be seen. EXTENDED SENSE CODES: NOTE for extended sense codes: A sense pin pair value of 0 means those pinsshould be tied together (as opposed to grounding the pins to pin 11); a valueof 1 means do not connect the pins.

Check with the vendor   about Macintosh Centris/Quadra compatibility before buying, or better yet,    actually try the monitor with a Quadra to see if it works and if the    quality is acceptable.  * Vendors have different image quality specifications.  There may be   significant differences between Apple monitors and the wide range of   VGA monitors.  Do a side-by-side comparison of the monitors you are   considering before buying.  * Many third party cable vendors have off-the-shelf cables that should work. Most NTSC devices use an RCA-type phono-connector and the following diagramuses that as a reference point.  A cable wired as follows may allow manydifferent brands of NTSC monitors to work on a Macintosh Centris or Quadra.  Iwould advise you to test the monitor on one of these machines prior to purchaseto see if it meets your expectations. Adjust the phono-connector side to whatever type of connector is used (RCA,BNC, etc.).  "Tip" is the pin in the center of the connector (the signal); thesleeve is flange around the outer edges of the connector (the chassis ground).    Card Connector                     RCA-Type Phono-Connector   --------------                     ------------------------   4      MON.ID1  (sense0) --|   7      MON.ID2  (sense1) --|   11     C&VSYNC.GND --------|    5      GRN.VID  -----------------> Tip (signal)   Shell  CHASSIS.GND --------------> Sleeve (ground) By grounding pin 4 and pin 7 to pin 11, the Macintosh Centris and Quadra CPUsare told that an NTSC monitor is attached.  The actual black and white videosignal is on pin 5 and connects to the center (Tip) of the phono-plug.  Theshell of the card connector connects to the sleeve of the phono-plug. To acquire a color NTSC signal from a Centris or Quadra (or any Apple Macintoshdisplay card), an RGB-to-composite video converter is required.VRAM Requirements for Supported Display Configurations------------------------------------------------------The frame buffers on the new Centris and Quadra machines support a variety ofpixel depths, from 1 to 16 bits per pixel (bpp).  The supported pixel depths(1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bpp) depend on the display resolution and the amount of VRAMpresent.  The fully expanded capability of all three machines is the same - 1MB of VRAM.  As with the Quadra 950, these machines can be expanded using 256K(i.e., 128K x 16) 80 nS VRAM SIMMs (although the C610 only requires 100 nsVRAM).  The following chart lists the Centris 610/650 and Quadra 800 built-in video'smaximum pixel depth supported depending upon the VRAM configuration: Display size                        512K VRAM     1MB VRAM 12-inch landscape384 x 512                           16 bpp         16 bpp 12-inch Monochrome640 x 480                            8 bpp          8 bpp 13-inch RGB & VGA640 x 480                            8 bpp         16 bpp  SVGA800 x 600                            8 bpp         16 bpp  15-inch Portrait (b/w)640 x 870                            4 bpp          8 bpp 16" Color,832 x 624                            8 bpp         16 bpp 19" Color,1024 x 768                           4 bpp          8 bpp 2-Page Display (b/w)1152 x 870                           4 bpp          8 bpp  21" Color1152 x 870                           4 bpp          8 bpp  PALunderscan-640x480                    8 bpp         16 bppoverscan-768x576                     8 bpp         16 bpp  NTSCunderscan-512x384                    8 bpp         16 bppoverscan- 640x480                    8 bpp         16 bpp Frans W.
