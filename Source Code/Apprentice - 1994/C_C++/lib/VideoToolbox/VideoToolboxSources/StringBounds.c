/*StringBounds.c	void StringBounds(unsigned char *s,Rect *bounds,long *count);Counts, and computes the minimum bounding rectangle for, all the pixels thatwould be set black by calling DrawString with the given pascal string, in thecurrent port, font, size, and style. (Assumes ForeColor is black and thatTextMode is srcOr, which are the default settings.) Coordinates in the *boundsrect are relative to the current pen position. If no pixels would be set then*bounds is set to the empty rect (0,0,0,0). The current port is left untouched.The bounds and count arguments are optional; they may be replaced by NULL.	void CharBounds(char a,Rect *bounds,long *count);Creates a one-char string and calls StringBounds().NOTESThe string argument "s" is a Pascal string, because that seems most convenient tothe caller, who will be almost immediately calling DrawString.bounds->right need not exactly equal the value returned by StringWidth(s),because StringWidth returns the displacement of the pen position, and some (e.g.italic) characters extend beyond that, while others (e.g. comma) extend lessfar. Similarly, bounds->left need not always be zero.By QuickDraw's convention, each pixel is considered to lie below and to theright of the point that is used to address it. The bounding rectangle for apixel at x,y, is SetRect(&r,x,y,x+1,y+1).HISTORY:1/17/94 dgp wrote it, based on discussion with Bart Farell and Manoj Gunwani.2/22/94	dgp	added count argument, and made both bounds and count optional.2/27/94	dgp since this routine is typically called repeatedly I save time			(0.2 s per call) by only allocating the GWorld once, and never			freeing it. It is reused on subsequent calls, resized appropriately			if necessary.*/#include <VideoToolbox.h>void CharBounds(char a,Rect *bounds,long *count);void StringBounds(unsigned char *s,Rect *bounds,long *count);void CharBounds(char a,Rect *bounds,long *countPtr){	unsigned char string[]="\pA";		string[1]=a;	StringBounds(string,bounds,countPtr);}void StringBounds(unsigned char *s,Rect *boundsPtr,long *countPtr){	static GWorldPtr our=NULL;	GWorldPtr old;	GDHandle oldDevice;	FontInfo f;    Rect r;	register unsigned long *pix,blank;	register int x,y;	register long count=0;	int n;	OSErr error;	Rect bounds;	// draw string into a new GWorld	GetFontInfo(&f);	SetRect(&r,0,-f.ascent,StringWidth(s),f.descent);	// nominal size	InsetRect(&r,-(f.widMax+2),-(f.leading+2)); 		// add margin	if(our==NULL)		error=NewGWorld(&our,1,&r,NULL,NULL,0);	else		error=UpdateGWorld(&our,1,&r,NULL,NULL,0);	if(error)PrintfExit("StringBounds: NewGWorld/UpdateGWorld error %d.\n",error);	GetGWorld(&old,&oldDevice);	SetGWorld(our,NULL);	TextFace(old->txFace);	TextFont(old->txFont);	TextSize(old->txSize);	EraseRect(&our->portRect);	MoveTo(0,0);	DrawString(s);	SetGWorld(old,oldDevice);		// measure the bounding box	r=our->portRect;	SetRect(&bounds,r.right,r.bottom,r.left,r.top);	n=r.right-r.left;	pix=(unsigned long *)malloc(n*sizeof(*pix));	if(pix==NULL)PrintfExit("StringBounds: Couldn't allocate %ld bytes.\n"		,n*sizeof(long));	SetGWorld(our,NULL);	OffsetRect(&bounds,-r.left,-r.top);	for(y=0;y<r.bottom-r.top;y++){		GetPixelsQuickly(r.left,r.top+y,pix,n);		if(y==0)blank=pix[0];		for(x=n-1;x>=0;x--)if(pix[x]!=blank){			count++;			if(x<bounds.left)bounds.left=x;			if(x>=bounds.right)bounds.right=x+1;			if(y<bounds.top)bounds.top=y;			if(y>=bounds.bottom)bounds.bottom=y+1;		}	}	OffsetRect(&bounds,r.left,r.top);	SetGWorld(old,oldDevice);	if(EmptyRect(&bounds))SetRect(&bounds,0,0,0,0);	free(pix);	//	DisposeGWorld(our);	if(boundsPtr!=NULL)*boundsPtr=bounds;	if(countPtr!=NULL)*countPtr=count;}
