/* SndPlay1.cSndPlay1(snd) plays a sound, asynchronously, i.e. it returns immediately, while thesound is still playing. The argument is a handle to a snd resource. If a sound is still playing from a previous call to SndPlay1, it is allowed to finish beforeclosing and reopening the channel and beginning the new sound.SndPlay1(NULL) waits for the sound to end and then closes the channel.SndStop1() closes the channel immediately.SndDone1() returns true once the last sound initiated by SndPlay1() has finished.GENERAL NOTE:The Apple Sound Manager has the annoying characteristic of insisting on loadingany synth that's mentioned in a snd resource, even if that synth is already loaded,which causes an error. This makes it necessary to dispose of and recreate the snd channel before each new sound, which these routines do. Apple advises against this approach because it leaves the channel open a lot of the time, which blocks SysBeep. To avoid this, make sure to call SndPlay1(NULL) or SndStop1() to close the channel afteryou start a sound going.The easiest way to get a sound to play is to call GetNamedResource(). 	Handle snd;	snd=GetNamedResource('snd ',"\pSimple Beep");However, it's also easy to create your own snd in memory, as a series of commands,following the instructions in Inside Mac VI.HISTORY:3/30/92	dgp wrote it.4/1/92	dgp	renamed it and commented out the printf's.7/9/93	dgp Test MATLAB in if() instead of #if. */#include "VideoToolbox.h"#include <Sound.h>static pascal void SndCallBack(SndChannelPtr channel,SndCommand command);static SndChannelPtr channel=NULL;static short soundDone;OSErr SndPlay1(Handle snd){	OSErr error=0;	SndCommand callBack;	static firstTime=1;	if(firstTime){		if(!MATLAB)_atexit(SndStop1);		firstTime=0;	}	if(channel!=NULL)error=SndDisposeChannel(channel,FALSE);	// wait till done	channel=NULL;	if(error)return error;	if(snd==NULL)return 0;	error=SndNewChannel(&channel,0,0L,SndCallBack);	if(error){//		printf("SndPlay1:SndNewChannel failed with error %d\n",error);		return error;	}	error=SndPlay(channel,snd,TRUE);	if(error){//		printf("SndPlay1:SndPlay failed with error %d\n",error);		return error;	}	soundDone=0;	callBack.cmd=callBackCmd;	callBack.param1=1;	callBack.param2=(long)&soundDone;	error=SndDoCommand(channel,&callBack,FALSE);//	if(error)printf("SndPlay1:SndDoCommand failed with error %d\n",error);	return error;}void SndStop1(void){	if(channel!=NULL)SndDisposeChannel(channel,TRUE);		// immediately	channel=NULL;}short SndDone1(void)// Returns true once the last sound initiated by SndPlay1 has // finished.{	return soundDone;}#pragma options(!profile)	// Disable profiling because A5 may be invalid.static pascal void SndCallBack(SndChannelPtr channel,SndCommand command)// Load a short int.// Called back by sound manager.
