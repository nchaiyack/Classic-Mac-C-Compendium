/*SetEntriesQuickly.cSetEntriesQuickly loads your video card’s clut as quickly as possible.This has been written by many people, and the “final” result has not been testedon all the computers and video devices it’s meant to support. The best test issimply to run TimeVideo, which gives it a thorough workout on all of yourcomputer’s video devices. Please send the report “TimeVideo results” todenis_pelli@isr.syr.edu, and I’ll add your test results to “Video synch”(section E). Naturally, we’ll try to fix bugs as they are discovered.Some Macintosh video drivers are poorly written; they take too long (more than aframe time) to load the clut. This is makes it impossible to do clut animationfor temporal modulation etc., for which one needs to be able to reload the cluton each frame. At one time many of us thought that the limitation was inhardware, in the RAMDAC, but we were wrong. Raynald Comptois disassembledseveral video drivers and wrote his own programs to load the clut quickly, andhis programs manage to do it within a frame. Raynald was kind enough to sharehis code with me. I passed it on to Peter Lennie and Bill Haake, who polishedit, making it compatible with the 68040 processor, and added support for morecards. I polished their work, made the routines self contained, adding a“device” argument to allow use in Macs that have more than one video device, andquickly figuring out all the key parameters (mode, pixelSize, DAC size, and clutsize). There are now two alternative front ends: SetEntriesQuickly() for newusers, and macltset() for backward compatibility with programs that usedRaynald’s original routines. This modularity has increased runtime onlyslightly, a fraction of a millisecond.New drivers are hard to write, since they must directly address the registers ofthe video card, which are unique to each video card and undocumented. So theauthor of a driver must disassemble the original video driver and figure thingsout on his or her own. A lot of work.SetEntriesQuickly is unlike the standard video drivers in the following ways:1. SetEntriesQuickly always takes less than 2 ms to load the whole clut. Some video drivers, e.g. for Apple’s 8•24 card, take several frames (>30 ms) to finish loading the clut.2A. SetEntriesQuickly does not wait for VBL, so a visible glitch may appear onthe current frame, at least on some older video cards (e.g. Hi-Res, Toby, andMac IIci). (You can prevent this glitch by calling SetEntriesQuickly only atblanking time. Use a VBL task or WaitForBlanking().) Newer cards and computersseem to have dual ported video clut memory so you can write at any point in theframe cycle without noticeable glitch, though of course you may want to synchthe update for other reasons.2B. A flag argument “waitForNextBlanking” is provided, but at present thisoption is only supported for the Toby video card.3. SetEntriesQuickly ignores the gamma table, yielding the same result as usingthe standard video driver with an uncorrected gamma table. E.g. after callingGDUncorrectedGamma(device).4. SetEntriesQuickly() does nothing and returns an error if the argumentsspecify loading of an out-of-range index. 5. SetEntriesQuickly() does nothing and returns an error if the “count”specifies zero entries. This is contrary to the (bizarre) Apple convention thata setEntries control call with a count corresponding to zero entries will resultin loading of entries specified by the “value” field of the ColorSpec.6. SetEntriesQuickly does not have immediate access to the video driver’sprivate tables. Therefore the first time you call SetEntriesQuickly() for a particular device there is an extra delay of about 1 ms while some keyinformation is ferreted out. That information is cached, so subsequent callsfor the same device will be fast, spending most of their time loading the clut.Two front ends are provided, for compatibility with two distinct traditions:OSErr SetEntriesQuickly(GDHandle device,short start,short count,ColorSpec *table);SetEntriesQuickly() uses the same calling convention as the VideoToolbox routineGDSetEntries() and, except for adding the GDHandle argument to specify thedevice, is also the same as Apple’s SetEntries() Color Manager routine,documented in Inside Macintosh V-143. Apple specifies special behavior whencount==-1, but we don’t support that here and simply return with an error. Isuggest that new users use SetEntriesQuickly rather that macltset. “start” isthe index of the first clut entry to load, and should be greater than or equalto zero. “count” is the number of entries to load, minus 1. (Yes, “minus 1”,that’s Apple’s convention.) “table” is a Colorspec array. (Each ColorSpecelement is a structure consisting of a two-byte “value”, which is not used, anda 6-byte “rgb”, which, in turn is a structure of three 16-bit unsigned shortints: red, green, and blue. Apple’s convention is that the MOST SIGNIFICANT BITSof the 16-bit color values are used. It’s good practice in your programs toprovide full 16-bit values, so that when you upgrade to fancier video cards withmore-than-eight bit DACs your programs will benefit from the extra precisionwithout needing any change. Returns zero if successful, nonzero if unsuccessful,i.e. illegal arguments.short macltset(GDHandle device,short start	,unsigned short* red,unsigned short* green,unsigned short* blue,short count1);macltset() uses a calling convention established by Raynald Comtois, andprovides backward compatibility with older programs. “red”, “green”, and “blue”are arrays of 16-bit unsigned short ints, of which the LEAST SIGNIFICANT BITSare used. “start” is the index of the first entry to change. “count1” is thenumber of entries to change (contrary to Apple’s convention).Both front ends use the same general-purpose subroutine: LoadClut(), which inturn calls the hardware-specific routine appropriate to the particular video device being used.The useMostSignificantBits bit of the “flags” argument specifies whether to use Apple’s convention (for users of SetEntriesQuickly) or Raynald’s convention (for users of macltset).At the moment all the supported video cards have 8-bit DACs, except the RasterOpsProColor 32, which has 9-bit DACs. If the useMostSignificantBits flag is truethen you don’t need to worry, as the least significant bit of the 9-bit DACsimply picks up the next lower bit from your numbers, giving you a tad moreprecision. However, if useMostSignificantBits flag is false then, in order touse the full range of the DAC you must make all your numbers twice as big, or --cludge time! -- set the useOnly8Bits flag, to request that your 8-bit numbers bemultiplied by two, allowing you to use the whole range of the DAC withoutchanging the rest of your program, but wasting the DAC’s least significant bitby setting it permanently to zero.SUSPENDING INTERRUPTS. If you wish, the low-level routines will suspendinterrupts while loading the clut. Presumably Raynald had his reasons forimplementing this, so this “feature” is enabled when you use macltset(). PeterLennie writes, “The switch to uninterruptable processing during the write is, Ithink, out of the original drivers (though I’m not absolutely sure).  I imagineit’s to avoid display glitches that would result from some higher priorityinterrupt suspending a clut rewrite somewhere in the middle.” However, I (dgp)don’t see any advantage to suspending interrupts, and believe that there is asignificant downside if you are trying to keep track of the VBL interrupts onseveral video cards, since suspending interrupts for 1 or 2 ms might be longenough to miss a whole VBL interval. Thus SetEntriesQuickly disables this“feature”. However, this is not a philosophical debate. We all agree thatinterrupts should be suspended if doing otherwise would occasionally result in avisible glitch. Does anyone know?OSErr WaitForNextBlanking(GDHandle device);Waits for beginning of next blanking interval. Currently this supports only theToby and HiRes cards (Apple’s original video cards, now obsolete).SPEED. SetEntriesQuickly() is self contained. You simply give it the GDHandle ofyour video device (as returned, e.g. by GetScreenDevice), and tell it what youwant to do to the clut. In order to do this for you it needs to figure out abunch of stuff about your video device. This research takes time; the first timeyou call it for a particular device it takes on the order of 1 ms to look upstuff. However, it saves this info in a cache, for each device, for quickretrieval on subsequent occasions. The implication is that programs that useSetEntriesQuickly ought to call it once just for practice (to get the cacheloading over with) before using it in a situation where speed matters.The coding of the LoadClut “driver” routines is a compromise between the needsof SetEntriesQuickly and macltset, which both use them. I decided not to writeseparate clut loading loops for the two cases (use most- vs. least-significantbits). I believe (but have not tested) that adding a register offset instead ofusing an autoincrement instruction incurs essentially no time penalty becausethe processor automatically overlaps the execution of such instructions. So Ithink that SetEntriesQuickly is running flat out, and don’t see any prospect ofspeeding it up significantly. On the other hand, I suspect that fetching theleast significant byte by doing a byte access to an odd address (for macltset)does slow things down perhaps 30% (though I haven’t timed it) over doing a wordaccess to an even address, as Raynald had originally coded it. If that speedloss is unacceptable, then one could insert an if(flags&useMostSignificantBits)statement into the relevant subroutine and write two separate loops optimizedfor the two cases. My guess is that the current compromise will be acceptable toall users.IMPROVEMENTS:It is hoped that others will add to the functionality of this routine. Pleaseshare your enhancements with others by sending them to denis_pelli@isr.syr.edufor inclusion in the VideoToolbox.Those wishing to support new video devices should begin by buying and readingApple’s Designing Cards and Drivers, 3rd Ed., Addison-Wesley, and then use theVideoToolbox utility GetVideoDrivers to copy all your drivers into resourcefiles, and use ResEdit with CODE editor to peruse them. The ResEdit CODE editoris a public domain file distributed by:Ira L. RubenApple Computer, Inc.20525 Mariani Ave., MS: 37-ACupertino, Ca. 95014Ira@Apple.Comftp.apple.com:/dts/mac/tools/resedit/resedit-2-1-code-editor...By the way, assembly code is hard to write, read, and maintain,and the speed advantage is negligible, about 10%. I suggest thatall new code be written in C.It is logical that we identify the video card by the card name,GDCardName(driver), but in fact getting the card name is very slow (1.5 ms)whereas getting the driver name is fast, GDName(driver), and would besufficiently unique for our purposes. (E.g. the Toby and TFB video cards havethe same driver, and our code works for both cards.) KNOWN BUGS:Has not been tested on all the video devices that are supposed to be supported.Please run the demo TimeVideo, and send the results file to denis_pelli@isr.syr.eduDoes not work with the RasterOps ProColor 32. Hopefully this will be fixed soon.The Quadra code requires that start==0. This could probably be figured out andfixed pretty easily if someone took the time to do so.I recommend using the standard drivers (i.e. GDSetEntries/GDDirectSetEntries)instead of SetEntriesQuickly for the Toby and High Resolution video cards andthe Mac IIci built-in video. Those standard drivers work fine, whereas for thosedevices SetEntriesQuickly produces visible dynamic black specks as it accessesthe clut.None of these routines wait for the vertical blanking interval before loadingthe clut. On older video devices--Toby, HiRes, Mac IIci--this results in visibledynamic black specks on the screen. I (dgp) consider this a bug, but, for mostof these devices I don’t know how to wait for the end of frame, short of settingup an interrupt. (Just about every video card has a bit that one could monitor,but its address is usually undocumented.) Newer devices seem to be ok, because ofdual-ported RAMDAC memory. Check this out on your devices by running TimeVideo.HISTORY:8/24/92 Original setcardbase and macltset provided by Raynald Comtois(raco@wjh12.harvard.edu) to Denis Pelli.10/2/92 Bill Haake added code for the RasterOps ProColor 32, which has 9-bitDACs and 9-bit entries in the lookup table.10/1/92 Peter Lennie added code for Quadra internal video.  No provision forchanging the start position in the table, (I couldn't find any relevantdisassembly) so 'start' is ignored, and you should write the whole table.	9/30/92 Bill Haake & Peter Lennie modified the code for the 8x24 cardand the 8x24GC to make it a) work properly in 32-bit mode. b) to fix a bug(feature?) of the original drivers that prevented the cards running on a Quadra.The drivers exploit 'byte-smearing' on the 68020 and 68030 (Tech Note 282). Thismeans that one can move a byte to the lowest byte address of the data registeron the card, when one actually wants to put it at address+3 (!!). The functionswork for all the cards (except toby, which hasn't been tested) and on internalvideo in both 24 and 32 bit mode on Quadra 700/950, IIfx or ci running system7.0.1.	9/28/92 Peter Lennie added the function findcard.11/23/92 Denis Pelli (dgp) eliminated all globals because they implicitlyassumed that there is only one video device. All routines now accept a GDHandlespecifying which video device. Simplified the logic of GetCardBase(), minimizingthe dependence on card type.11/25/92 dgp When USE_MSB is true, all the routines now use the most significantbits of the 16-bit elements of the user-supplied color tables. When it is falsethe least significant bits are used. This is mostly implemented by offseting thetable pointers by one byte and only reading the desired byte. •Generalizedmacltset() to work with tables that have an arbitrary element spacing. Thisallows it to work with both with Raynald's convention of three arrays of shorts,and the Apple convention of a ColorSpec array, each element of which consists ofred, green, blue, and value (which is not used). •Added alias "Toby frame buffercard" for tobycard.11/27/92 dgp Broke out the code for each card into separate subroutines. Thisallows optimal register assignment for each routine, and makes it much easier to readthe THINK C disassembler output. The runtime overhead of loading and unloadingthe stack is negligible, and could be eliminated entirely by putting all theparameters in a structure and passing a pointer to it. •Added a flag,suspendInterrupts, to make interrupt suspension optional since it may beundesirable in some applications. (Blocking interrupts for 1 ms could cause youto miss the interrupt from a video card, especially if you are trying to keeptrack of interrupts on several video cards at once.)11/30/92 dgp Wrote TestCluts, which reads back the clut and checks allvalues, and used it to test SetEntriesQuickly() on Quadra 950 internal video,Mac IIci internal video, hirescard, "Toby frame buffer card", and 8•24 card atall depths, for both 24- and 32-bit addressing. Toby card was tested on 68020,68030, and 68040 processors. •Wrote documentation. •Replaced compile-time constantsUSE_MSB and PRO_8BITS by runtime flags passed as arguments. •Added WaitForNextBlanking()based on code from VideoTFB.c.12/3/92 dgp Incorporated Peter Lennie's corrections and additions to the comments above.12/8/92 dgp Added missing "case" to switch in WaitForNextBlanking.12/13/92 dgp Changed erroneous "&d" to "%d" in a printf. Added some comments tothe documentation above.			12/15/92 dgp Now get mode from device record and leave it in standard form, i.e. with the 0x80 bit set, and only strip off that bit when actually necessary,e.g. in LoadClutMacIIci. 12/30/92 dgp Make sure routines return zero when there's no error.2/15/93	dgp Rewrote nonworking LoadClutToby in C, and made it work. Rewrotenonworking LoadClutx824 in C, and made it work. Fixed sixteenBitMode inLoadClutQuadra. Use new SwapPriority instead of Get/SetPriority.2/20/93	dgp	Translated LoadClutGCx824 to C. (It was ignoring the start value.)3/4/93	dgp	Added macIIsi to list of supported cards, since it uses the samedriver as the Mac IIci. Changed definitions of string types slightly to allowcompilation of this file as a code resource. However, the assembly codeuses more registers than are available to a code resource.4/13/93	dgp	Removed 68020 requirement by translating an indexed add in LoadMacIIci toC.4/17/93 dgp Added support in GetCardBase for old Mac II computers whose ROM's only support 24-bit NuBus addressing. 5/18/93 SetEntriesQuickly now respects the setting of the device's gray/color mode, and maps to gray if in the device is in gray mode and pixelSize<=8. Changed prototypeof macltset to specify the red, green, and blue arrays as "unsigned short" instead of "short".7/7/93	dgp	Disabled some global optimizations because THINK C 6 willcrash while compiling if the Radius PowerView is present: "!gopt_induction,!gopt_loop".7/9/93	dgp check for 32-bit addressing capability.*/#include "VideoToolbox.h"#include <assert.h>#define USE_ONLY_8_BITS_IN_MACLTSET 0	// 1 to use RasterOps ProColor32 as an 8-bit DAC.#pragma options(assign_registers,honor_register,redundant_loads,defer_adjust)#pragma options(global_optimizer,!gopt_induction,!gopt_loop,gopt_cse,gopt_coloring)// These are the five user-callable routines:OSErr WaitForNextBlanking(GDHandle device);OSErr SetEntriesQuickly(GDHandle device,short start,short count,ColorSpec *table);short macltset(GDHandle device,short start	,unsigned short* red,unsigned short* green,unsigned short* blue,short count1);short GetCardType(GDHandle device);char *GetCardBase(GDHandle device);/*I suggest keeping the following information private to this file.
