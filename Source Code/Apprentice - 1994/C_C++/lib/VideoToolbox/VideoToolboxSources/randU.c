/*randU.cDenis G. Pellii=randU();randU() is the Standard C random number generator rand()Ñsee K&RÑ modified toreturn 16 bits as an unsigned short int instead of just 15 bits as a (positive)short int. Both versions satisfy Knuth's prescriptions for a linear congruentialrandom number generator, namely, given that the modulus is 2^32, the multipliershould be between 0.01m and 0.99m, the multiplier mod 8 should be 5, and theaddend should be odd. (Knuth also recommends doing spectral testing of themultiplier, and I don't know if that's been done. One would like to think thatthe Standard C committee would have chosen a multiplier that had been so tested.)j=randUL();randUL() returns a 32-bit random number, formed by calling randU() twice andgluing the results together.RandFill(address,bytes);RandFill is a tight coding of randU() optimized for filling large buffers. It's twiceas fast as making repeated calls to randU(), but is numerically equivalent, and even uses the same seed. For high speed it must be compiled to use the 68020 (or better)chip, otherwise each long multiplication requires a subroutine call. Fills 0.8 MB/s on a Mac IIci, i.e. 25 MHz 68030.Kernighan, B.

I do this by moving the entire long register to memory,overwriting the least significant two bytes on the next iteration. As a resultthis method requires a 2 byte overhang beyond the end of the desired data. Thatoverhang region and an odd byte, if any, is filled in by copying from aworkArea.A simpler way to implement this overhang business would have been to copy thememory that was to be overwritten, overfill the buffer, and then restore theoverwritten memory. The problem with that method is that it assumes theoverwritten memory exists (e.g. it might be video memory) and won't be usedwhile we're running, which is not an entirely safe assumption unless we turn offinterrupts. So I took the cautious approach, which makes for a messier lookingprogram, but it's safe. The performance cost is negligible.*/void RandFill(void *address,long bytes){	register long i;	register unsigned long s,mul,add;	register unsigned short *ptr;	unsigned short *savePtr,workArea[3];	s=seed.L;	mul=1103515245L;	add=12345L;	ptr=(unsigned short *)address;	i=bytes;	i-=2;					/* allow guard room for overshoot */	/* Because of the unrolling, the loop overhead is only 3% of running time */	for(;i>=32;i-=32) {		/* this compiles to 4 instructions: MULU.L, ADD.L, MOVE.L, ADDQ.L */		s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;		s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;		s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;		s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;		s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;		s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;		s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;		s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;		s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;		s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;		s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;		s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;		s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;		s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;		s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;		s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;	}	for(;i>=2;i-=2) {		s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;	}	i+=2;					/* remove guard */	savePtr=ptr;	ptr=&workArea[0];	s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;	s *= mul; s += add; *(unsigned long *)ptr=s; ptr++;	memcpy(savePtr,workArea,i);	seed.L=s;}
