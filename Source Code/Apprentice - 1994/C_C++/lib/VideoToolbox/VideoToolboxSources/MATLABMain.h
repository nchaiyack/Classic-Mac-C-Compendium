/*MATLABMain.hThis header allocates space for QuickDraw globals for use by THINK C MATLABprojects. It should be #included in the main C file of each THINK C MATLABproject, i.e. in the C file that contains "main" or "user_fcn". It must beincluded in exactly one source file of each project, as the THINK C Linker willotherwise complain.Some older programs instead #define the symbol "MAIN" before #includingthe VideoToolbox.h header. If MAIN is defined then VideoToolbox.h #includesMATLABMain.h. This older approach is not recommended for new programsbecause it fails if you precompile the VideoToolbox.h header.It might seem dangerous that VideoToolbox.h can include this file and thatthis file, in turn, includes VideoToolbox.h. Actually it's fine becauseVideoToolbox.h has preprocessor directives that guarantee that it will onlybe included once.HISTORY:93		dhb wrote it9/15/93	dgp	extracted it from VideoToolbox.h*/#pragma once#include "VideoToolbox.h"	// defines "THINK_C_QD"#if MATLAB && defined(THINK_C)	THINK_C_QD mex_qd;	/*  Allocate storage for QuickDraw globals. */#endif
