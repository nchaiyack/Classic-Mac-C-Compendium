Various routines that deal with Binomial statistics, including generating random
samples and computing confidence intervals.

This file contains two generations of routines that generate confidence
intervals. The original routines BinomialUpperBound and BinomialLowerBound are
old, but are more robust. The new routines are based on a Numerical Recipes in C
routine to compute the incomplete beta function. The new routines add little to
the old routines, and require the Numerical Recipes in C, so I commented them
out. The new routines do have the advantage of allowing an arbitrary confidence,
whereas the old routines were hard coded to produce a 95% confidence interval.

Also see: ChiSquare.c, Exponential.c, Normal.c, Uniform.c

HISTORY:
1/5/91 Added new binomial routines. These routines may be 
		commented out by setting NEW_BINOMIAL to zero.
1/7/91 Rewrote BinomialUpperBound & BinomialLowerBound to allow specification of the
		desired confidence of the interval.
4/24/92	dgp	Added BinomialSampleQuickly().
4/27/92	dgp	Oops. I just noticed that this file was always including nr.h, which you'd
			only have if you own the Numerical Recipes. I moved the include statement
			down inside the conditional below, where it belongs.

to use the more elaborate Numerical Recipes bnldev() routine.

/*
BinomialUpperBound and BinomialLowerBound return a P confidence interval for the
underlying binomial probability assumed to have generated the data.

The formula is based on a Gaussian approximation, solving for the p that will
put the observed result the right number of standard deviations away from the
mean, plus or minus 0.5, as a "continuity correction".

This is the best formula I could find in looking through several statistics
books. However, the result has to be taken with a grain of salt because it is
not possible to produce a binomial confidence interval that will satisfy the
strict definition of a confidence interval, namely one that will have the
specified probability P of containing the unknown but fixed parameter p. That's
because, unlike the Normal distribution, the Binomial distribution is not
translation invariant. E.g. if p is actually zero then the true confidence interval
ALWAYS contains p.

I gave some thought to taking a Bayesian approach, assuming a uniform prior pdf
for p and then computing an a posteriori confidence interval. This can be done,
but it's hard. I concluded that it's pointless because the uniform pdf
assumption is usually unwarranted.

Even though this confidence interval is unsatisfactory (i.e. fundamentally
false) it is useful in practice since it typically behaves similarly to the
Normal case, which is theoretically sound.
