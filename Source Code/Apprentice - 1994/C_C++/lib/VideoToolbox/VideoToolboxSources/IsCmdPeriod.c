/*IsCmdPeriod.cYou pass it an event record and it tells you whether or not the user has hitcommand-period (i.e. "cancel"). The straightforward way breaks on some non-USSystems because the keys get remapped (i.e. period!='.'). The elaborate way issupposed to work on all Systems, but hasn't been tested.WARNING:This hasn't been tested. I haven't read the Script Manager chapter. The cachingscheme (saving "period") might fail if you change script systems between callsto IsCmdPeriod.dgp.Copied from comp.sys.mac.programming:From: k044477@hobbes.kzoo.edu (Jamie R.

I think I took it pretty much straight fromthe TN, but I might have made some minor improvement, I don't recallwhat.
