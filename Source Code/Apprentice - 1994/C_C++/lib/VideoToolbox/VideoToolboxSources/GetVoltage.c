/*GetVoltage.c© 1990,1991,1992 Denis G. PelliThese subroutine are for measuring voltages via the Data Translation DT2211-PGLFORERUNNER analog NuBus card. The assumed unit-gain input range is VMIN to VMAX,e.g. 0 to 5 Volts. If you change this input range (by changing the jumpers on the card)then these defined constants should be changed appropriately. The on-board FIFO holds 1024 samples, so you can use InitiateVoltageSampling() tostart the conversion, do something else, and come back later to collect the results,by calling RetrieveVoltages(). All the other routines are built upon these two.BUGS:RetrieveVoltages() hangs up at high clock rates and high gains (e.g. 100 kHz at gain 1or 10 kHz at gain 500). This is almost certainly some sort of hardware problem.Perhaps Data Translation could advise a work-around. What happens is thatwe wait forever for the Control and Status Register to indicate that there isvalid data. (It checks before getting each of the n samples.)Since the clock is presumably still running the data ought to appeareventually, even if the a/d can't quite keep up. Anyway, I can do all my work at2 kHz or lower, so it's not an issue for me.***6/23/92 This problem now occurseven at 2 kHz, but it may be an interaction with the Radius Rocket.I don't understand why, but the THINK C profiler timing data indicates that RetrieveVoltages() is much too fast on the cases where a voltageOverflow occurs.The most likely explanation for this is some sort of glitch in the Profiler, probablyan interaction with printf, so I'm ignoring it.HISTORY:8/8/89	dgp	written by denis,based on an early draft by Preeti9/29/89 dgp	changed the #defines so that slot number appears in only one place.3/28/90 dgp	call the new function CardSlot() that actually finds the ForeRunner card			on the NuBus if present, and fail gracefully if it's absent.9/13/90	dgp	Added standard deviation to GetVoltage(). Tidied up the comments.9/14/90	dgp	Broke up code into separate routines that initiate the sampling, and			later retrieve the samples.			Improved the error detection, handling, and reporting.			Made explicit and general the dependence on the unit-gain input voltage range.			Elaborated the main() test driver.			Sped up the key loop in RetrieveVoltages().10/17/90 dgp removed unused variables from InitiateVoltageSampling() and			RetrieveVoltages().5/21/91	dgp	GetVoltage() now automatically tries again at lower gain if there was			a voltage overflow. I also added the voltage limits to the diagnostic			messages.8/24/91		dgp	Made compatible with THINK C 5.0.6/22/92	dgp	added a brief pause between successive interrogations of the fifo when			fetching data, to prevent hang ups. I suspect that the problem			is that the fifo's input and output are not totally independent and the			excessively frequent interrogation of the output (waiting for the data			available flag to come up) prevented the fifo from accepting data.6/23/92	dgp	well, the last fix helped but didn't solve the problem. I now explicitly			time out if the next data point doesn't appear after a reasonable wait			(100000 iterations). I modified the calling structure of GetVoltages and			RetrieveSamples to pass the number of samples by reference so that			when there is a buffer overflow or timeout the programs can proceed			using the reduced number of data actually retrieved.10/23/92 dgp removed obsolete support for THINK C 4. Fine tuned RetrieveVoltages()			to make it as fast as possible. Removed all the beeps in the error			messages, because they annoyed me.*/#include "VideoToolbox.h"#include <math.h>#define VMAX 5.0	/* unit-gain input range of a/d assumed to be VMIN to VMAX volts */#define VMIN 0.0#define BASE_ADDR(slot) 	(0xf0080000+(slot)*0x1100000)#define CS_REG 		0x00#define	AD_DATA		0x10#define DAC_0_DATA	0x20#define DAC_1_DATA	0x30#define	DIO_COUNTER 0x40#define DIO_DATA	0x50#define GAINS 4static double gain[GAINS]={1.,10.,100.,500.};#define FREQUENCIES 64static double frequency[FREQUENCIES]={	0.005,0.006,0.010,0.012,0.015,0.020,0.030,	0.050,0.060,0.060,0.100,0.120,0.150,0.200,0.300,	0.500,0.600,0.600,1.0,1.200,1.500,2.0,3.0,	5.0,6.0,6.0,10.0,12.0,15.0,20.0,30.0,	50.0,60.0,60.0,100.0,120.0,150.0,200.0,300.0,	500.0,600.0,600.0,1000.0,1200.0,1500.0,2000.0,3000.0,	5000.0,6000.0,6000.0,10000.0,12000.0,15000.0,20000.0,30000.0,	50000.0,60000.0,60000.0,100000.0,120000.0,150000.0,200000.0,300000.0,600000.0};static short frequencyCode[FREQUENCIES]={	63,15,55,47,39,31,23,62,14,7,54,46,38,30,22,	61,6,13,53,45,37,29,21,60,12,5,52,44,36,28,20,	59,11,4,51,43,35,27,19,58,3,10,50,42,34,26,18,	57,9,2,49,41,33,25,17,56,1,8,48,40,32,24,16,0};#if 0#include <profile.h>void main(void);void main(){	int i,k;	short channel=1;	long n=2000;	static double g=1.0,f=2000.,sd,voltDelta,voltZero,mean;	static unsigned short data[2000];		Require(0);	for(i=0;i<3;i++)printf("%6.2f mV\n",1000.*VoltsDuringFrame(20));	InitProfile(200,3);	for(k=0;k<3;k++){		g=gain[k];		mean=GetVoltage(channel,&g,&f,n,&sd);		printf("n %ld,mean %f V,sd %f V,g %3.0f,f %.3f",n,mean,sd,g,f);		mean=GetVoltages(channel,&g,&f,n,data,&voltDelta,&voltZero);		printf(",range is %.3f to %.3f V\n",voltZero,voltDelta*4095+voltZero);		for(i=0;i<10;i++)printf("%5d",data[i]);		printf("\n");	}}#endifdouble VoltsDuringFrame(double frames)/* sample channel 1 at 2 kHz for the specified number of 15 ms frames */{	double gain=10.;	double frequency=2000.;	long n;	short channel=1;		n=(long)(0.5+frequency*0.015*frames);	return GetVoltage(channel,&gain,&frequency,n,NULL);}double GetVoltage(short channel,double *gainPtr,double *frequencyPtr,long nDesired	,double *sdPtr)/*Samples at specified rate, gain, and number of samples and returns the mean voltage.If sdPtr is not NULL, then the standard deviation is computed and returned in *sdPtr.*/{	unsigned short *readingsPtr;	double voltDelta,voltZero,v;	int error,i;	register unsigned long sum,m;	register double sumSquares;	long n;	tryAgain:	if(nDesired >= 1L<<20){		printf("GetVoltage: n %ld too large\n",nDesired);		return NAN;	}	readingsPtr=(unsigned short *)NewPtr(nDesired*sizeof(unsigned short));	if(readingsPtr==NULL){		printf("GetVoltage: out of memory!\n");		return NAN;	}	n=nDesired;	error=GetVoltages(channel,gainPtr,frequencyPtr,&n,readingsPtr,&voltDelta,&voltZero);	if(error & voltageBufferOverflow){		printf("GetVoltage: Warning: retrieved only %4ld of the %4ld samples requested.\n",n,nDesired);	}	if(error & voltageOverflow){		if(*gainPtr>gain[0]){			printf("GetVoltage: voltageOverflow >%.2f V at gain %.0f.
