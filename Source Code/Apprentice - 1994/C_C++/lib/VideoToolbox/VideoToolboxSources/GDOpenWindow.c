/* GDOpenWindow.cCopyright © 1989-1994 Denis G. PelliSUMMARY:AddExplicitPalette(window) adds a palette to a color window or GWorld with all thecolors marked as pmExplicit. This allows you to use PmForeColor() andPmBackColor() to specify the value you want poked into each pixel by QuickDrawoperations, e.g. EraseRect() and DrawString().RemovePalette(window) disposes of the palette created by AddExplicitPalette.window=GDOpenWindow1(device) opens a full-screen window on the specified screen,and calls AddExplicitPalette. The window truly fills the screen: any rounded corners are made square and if the window is on the main screen then the Menu Bar ishidden.GDDisposeWindow1(window) closes and discards a color window, disposing of any paletteor color table, generally undoing whatever GDOpenWindow1 did.These routines return and accept a WindowPtr (even though it's actuallya color window), which seems to be the standard way of doing things. The older routines, without the "1" suffix, return and accept a CWindowPtr,which ends up forcing you to do a lot of tedious casting, e.g. when you callSetPort(), which wants a WindowPtr.COMMENTS:QuickDraw likes to pick a bunch of good colors and stuff them in the clut, inessentially random order, except that white is first and black is last. It wantsyou to specify any desired color as an RGB triplet and then it picks the mysteriousclut index that would provide the closest match. If you're processing grayscaleimages, then QuickDraw's approach involves a lot of overhead involving inversecolor tables, and makes the numbers stored in your pixels meaningless (unlessyou look them up in the associated color table or palette).The philosophy of the VideoToolbox is to bypass QuickDraw's color model, andwork explicitly with the numbers that are stored in your pixels.SetPixelsQuickly will efficiently poke (or peek) numbers in your PixMap.However, if you want to use QuickDraw's drawing operations, especiallyEraseRect() and DrawString() then you need a way to specify the foreground andbackground colors. AddExplicitPalette() gives your window a palette in which allthe colors are marked as pmExplicit. This tells the palette manager not tomeddle, and to use your arguments to PmForeColor() and PmBackColor() literally.I suggest that you control the clut by calling GDUncorrectedGamma() andGDSetEntries(), since these calls directly control the video device driver,bypassing the Color Manager. Since the Color and Palette Managers don't knowthat you've changed the color environment they can't react to it, and willpassively let you continue to specify colors by their clut index. For example,the Palette Manager religiously believes that the first clut entry should bewhite and the last one black, and it will change them back to those values ifyou change them and it finds out about it. If you use the Color ManagerSetEntries call then the Paletter Manger WILL find out because a record is madein the ColorTable. Calling GDSetEntries() bypasses the Color Manager. Instead,the video device driver writes directly to the clut and the ColorTable is notmodified. Of course, this means that you should ignore the ColorTable since itwill no longer reflect the contents of the clut.The Inside Mac books suggest that a new color window should be given its owncolor table. This will happen if you set MAKE_COLOR_TABLE true. However, for mypurposes I think of the window and the screen as essentially the same thing, soI give the window a handle to the screen's color table, so they share the sametable.Every time you access the stdio package, e.g. printf or getch(), THINK C willmove the Console window to the front, which may obscure your window. You canbring your window back to the front by calling BringToFront().EXAMPLE:Open your window by saying:	window=GDOpenWindow1(device);When you're through with the window, get rid of it by calling:	GDDisposeWindow1(window);Besides closing the window and disposing of the allocated memory structures itrestores the device's clut to whatever is in the color table associated with device.HISTORY:12/88		dgp	wrote it8/5/89			added call to GDUncorrectedGamma, so I couldn't forget.8/15/89 	dgp trivia3/20/90		dgp	make compatible with MPW C.3/29/90		dgp	changed declared returned type from WindowPtr to CWindowPtr, which				is what it's really been all along. Same change to argument of				GDDisposeWindow(). The new offscreen GWorld calls for the first time				make it easier to honestly declare one's windows as color rather				than pretending they're not.8/24/91		dgp	Made compatible with THINK C 5.0.2/1/92		dgp Made optional the device argument to GDDisposeWindow(). If it's				NULL, then it will be determined automatically from window.2/3/93		dhb	Extracted AddExplicitPalette from GDOpenWindow.2/21/93		dgp	HideMenuBar if window is on main screen.2/23/93		dgp AddExplicitPalette() returns immediately unless it receives a color 				window.				Added GDOpenWindow1() and GDDisposeWindow1(), which both use				a WindowPtr, instead of a less convenient CWindowPtr.3/5/93		dgp	Added calls to UnclipScreen() and RestoreScreenClipping(), so the window				now truly fills the whole screen. Edited GDOpenWindow() for clarity.3/7/83		dgp	Added calls to GDSaveGamma(device) and GDRestoreGamma(device).4/16/93		dgp	Cosmetic editing.5/22/93		dgp	Added RemovePalette(), but didn't test it.1/27/94		dgp	Cosmetic editing.3/5/94		dgp	Decided that RemovePalette() works fine now.*/#include "VideoToolbox.h"#define MAKE_COLOR_TABLE 0CWindowPtr GDOpenWindow(GDHandle device)// Obsolete.

I worried that the Window orPalette Manager might become confused if it later tries to access thewindow's palette, which no longer exists. However, by trial and errorI've found that this works fine, and that my attempts to make explicit thefact that the palette is gone, e.g. by calling SetPalette(window,NULL,0),all produced crashes. I conclude that the Palette or Window Manager monitorsthe calls to DisposePalette and thus knows that the palette is gone.*/
