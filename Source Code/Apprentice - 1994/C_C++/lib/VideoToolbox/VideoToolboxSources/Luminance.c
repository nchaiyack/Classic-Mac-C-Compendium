Added LoadClut() and LuminanceClut() routines.7/30/89 dgp replaced call to SetEntries (which calls the Color Manager) by a call			to GDSetEntries (which calls the device driver).8/10/89 dgp fixed bugs.8/13/89 dgp rewrote LToV() to use nth order polynomial. Broke up LinearizeClut into			three routines--SetLuminanceRange, SetLuminance, and SetLuminances--the			last of which is equivalent to the old LinearizeClut.8/16/89	dgp	After reading the Brooktree DAC manual I changed the documentation and			increased tolerance from 0.5 to 1 LSB, and now use the highest			luminance gain (worst case) over the requested range to transform it			into a luminance difference tolerance.8/21/89	dgp	Made minor improvements in LToV() to deal with failure to converge due to 			getting stuck in a local minimum of the quartic. My solution is to now			require that Lmin and Lmax be filled in by the user in the calibration			structure. In practice this will guarantee that the minimum luminance			will not be below the local minimum found at the base of the rising curve.			Last week I also changed the LToV algorithm slightly, to do a bisection if			Newton's method would take us out of range.9/7/89 dgp	Fixed bug in sorting routine, Sort().9/10/89 dgp	Commented out the polynomial versions of VToL and LToV and replace them by			new versions that use a power law. The power law is a marginally better fit			than a 6th order polynomial (using only 4 instead of 7 parameters) and its			inverse can be computed much more quickly, about 0.3 ms instead of 2 ms.9/11/89 dgp	Deciding to be indecisive, I introduced a conditional POWER_LAW_FIT			to control the choice of power law or polynomial fit for LToV and VToL.9/16/89	dgp	Having finished writing the paper (Pelli & Zhang, 1991) I came back to			change the program to agree with what I wrote. I changed the equivalent			number tolerance to be the sum instead of the maximum of the 			variable-dac gains.9/25/89 dgp Fixed minor bug in computation of tolerance. Now gives correct answer even			when the lowLuminance or highLuminance is out of range.10/9/89 dgp	Made minor change so that when some of the gain[] are zero SetLuminance will			load zero into the unused colorSpec array elements. This is only a cosmetic			change.10/28/89 dgp Made minor changes. I declared LToVPolynomial and LToVPower and			VToLPolynomial and VToLPower instead of having a conditional compilation. 			This makes both flavors of routine always available. I also changed 			LToVPolynomial to use LToVPower instead of LToVQuadratic for its initial 			guess. The quadratic guess was often poor and occasionally led to 			convergence problems. If the power law fit is not available then it reverts			to using the quadratic fit. If that's not available then it reverts to using			a middle-of-range guess.10/28/89 dgp I eliminated the compile-time flag POWER_LAW_FIT and instead use whichever, 			polynomial or power, provides a better fit, as determined at run time. I 			biased the comparison of rms error to favor the power law fit since it has 			few parameters and can be inverted much more quickly. Note: if the 			power, polynomial, or quadratic fit parameters are not supplied then the 			appropriate LR.powerError, LR.polynomialError, or LR.quadraticError field 			should be set to infinity: INF or 1.0/0.0.12/5/89	dgp	Added the trivial routine LToL() which enforces the bounds LP->LMin and 			LP->LMax.4/2/90	dgp	Capitalized the word "To" in all function names, e.g. LToL().4/22/90	dgp	Version 1.4. Made minor changes to the documentation. Renamed LToV() to			LToVFormulaic(), and introduced a new LToV() that uses a table to run faster.			LToV() takes an average of 170 µs, whereas LToVFormulaic() takes			1700 µs. I also now use the luminanceTable, if available, to speed up			VToL() slightly, from 310 µs to 180 µs. Each call to SetLuminance() now			takes 0.9 ms whereas it used to take 2.5 ms. The loss in accuracy is			negligible. The interpolation error can be reduced still further by			increasing LUMINANCES_IN_TABLE. Each doubling of the table size quarters the			maximum possible error of the interpolation.4/23/90	dgp	Added a few lines of code to LToV() to check near the last index, in the			spirit of Numerical Recipes in C, hunt.c, before starting the bisection			search. I updated the times in the 4/22/90 note to reflect the latest timing			by TestLuminance.7/27/90	dgp	Tightened up the error checking for illegal entries into the clut. I have			the impression that, contrary to specification, the Apple video driver			crashes and corrupts itself if given an out-of-range entry value in a			setEntry Control call.9/18/90	dgp	Changed all instances of "v" to "V". The final version of the Pelli			& Zhang (1991) paper refers to the nominal voltage v; this file			now refers to the "equivalent number" V; they are related by V=255*v.9/24/90	dgp	Updated the documentation to correspond more closely to the (hopefully)			final version of the Pelli & Zhang (1991) paper.10/29/90 dgp Doubled speed of SetLuminance(). Now SetLuminance() takes 133 ms to			do a complete clut for a small new luminance range, and takes 188 ms for a			large new range. This required minor changes to SetLuminanceRange() & LToV().			Changed all function headers to Standard C prototype style.10/30/90 dgp Replaced phrase "clut value" by "nominal voltage", for consistency with			Pelli & Zhang (1991).			Introduced new fixed fraction data type called "Milli", defined in Milli.h.			By judicious replacement of double by Milli, particularly in the luminance			table, I have increased the speed of SetLuminance by a factor of three.			A Mac II now takes only 42 to 50 ms to build a whole clut. This new feature			is enabled by setting FAST_LUMINANCE to 1 in Luminance.h. There is a slight			increase in the luminance tolerance.10/31/90 dgp More fine tuning. Now takes 31 to 44 ms to build a whole clut. Introduced			conditional FAST_LUMINANCE in Luminance.h that causes the same code to			be compiled with either Milli or double variables. The _SetLuminance()			routine is now quite polished, and runs fast. All variables and routines			whose names begin with underscore _ are written here with type Milli, but			if FAST_LUMINANCE is false then this type is redefined (in this file only)			as double, and all the Milli macros are redefined to be appropriate for			a double. So bear in mind that things beginning with underscore are of			unknown type. The virtue of being able to run the same code with Milli or			double computations is that if you suspect an error in the (homemade)			Milli arithmetic, you can try out double arithmetic simply by setting			FAST_LUMINANCE to 0 and recompiling.			In the interest of speed I have streamlined the tolerance			computation. The new tolerances are probably as good as the old ones.11/2/90 dgp Added _SetLuminances() subroutine that substitutes linear interpolation			for most of the calls to _LToV(). This has greatly speeded up			SetLuminancesAndRange(), with minor loss of accuracy. A complete clut now			takes 9 to 31 ms. Even a Mac II can now compute low-contrast cluts			on the fly, between frames. (The user may wish to optimize the speed-			accuracy trade-off controlled by the LINEAR_V_DOMAIN parameter, which			determines the maximum width of the interpolation interval.)11/6/90 dgp Replaced Milli by FIXED, which can be compiled as either double or Fixed.			The Fixed math is sufficiently precise as to give the same DAC values as			double math.			Now figure out optimal bit shift LT->L.LShift to preserve as much resolution			as possible when interpolating in _LToV(). 			A complete clut now takes 8 to 30 ms. For threshold stimuli the average			time will usually be less than 15 ms.11/8/90 dgp	Eliminated gamma slope table since the speed-up it offered was too small			to measure. Tidied up the computation of LShift.8/24/91	dgp	Made compatible with THINK C 5.0.12/17/91 dgp Added new routines: IncrementLuminance() and GetV().			The former is used to obtain the lowest possible contrast. On a log contrast			scale, minus infinity (zero contrast) is a poor approximation to even			a small log contrast.3/11/92	dgp	Minor editing of comments.12/2/92 dgp Fixed minor bug in SetLuminanceRange() reported by Wei Xie and Ken Alexander			that could cause the THINK C Debugger to report an error when an 			uninitialized double V[] was converted to an int. The value was not used 			for anything, so this was innocuous.12/17/92 dgp 1.94 Began enhancement to allow any dacSize, not just 8-bit dacs. I have			confirmed that everything still works fine with 8-bit dacs, but I don't			have a 9-bit dac video card to test it any further. ¥CAUTION: this probably			does not yet work correctly for 9-bit dacs. E.g. it seems likely that the 			fixed point math will break if VMax is increased to 511; a lot of careful 			error analysis went into the original coding, at which time I thought that 			it was safe to assume an 8-bit dac (i.e. VMax==255). ¥Removed obsolete 			support for THINK C 4. 12/21/92 dgp No longer load unused dac bits.1/4/93	dgp	LoadLuminances now checks the gdType.5/10/93	dgp	If driver is in gray mode (i.e. not color) then LoadLuminances maps rgb to 			gray by simply copying the green component to the red and blue components.5/12/93	dgp removed debugging code that forced isGray to always be true.3/24/94	dgp	added LToE, LToEOrdered, and EToL.*/#include "VideoToolbox.h"		/* prototype for GDSetEntries() */#include "Luminance.h"#include <assert.h>#include <math.h>static void Sort(int n,double arr[],int krr[]);	/* for internal use only */#undef LongToFix#undef FixToLong#undef DoubleToFix#undef FixToDouble#if FAST_LUMINANCE	#define FIXED Fixed	#if !MACINTOSH		typedef long Fixed;		#define FixMul(x,y) DoubleToFix(FixToDouble(x)*FixToDouble(y))		#define FixDiv(x,y) DoubleToFix(FixToDouble(x)/FixToDouble(y))	#endif	#define LongToFix(x) ((long)(x)<<16)	#define FixToLong(x) ((x)>>16)	#define DoubleToFix(x) ((Fixed)((x)*65536.+0.5))	#define FixToDouble(x) ((double)(x)*(1./65536.))	#define D(x) FixToDouble(x)							/* handy for debugging */#else	#define FIXED double	#define FixMul(x,y) ((double)(x)*(y))	#define FixDiv(x,y) ((double)(x)/(y))	#define LongToFix(x) ((double)(x))	#define FixToLong(x) ((long)(x))	#define DoubleToFix(x) ((double)(x))	#define FixToDouble(x) ((double)(x))#endif#undef MAX#undef MIN#define MAX(a,b) ((a) > (b) ?

Since we're inscribing straight line segments in apositively accelerating gamma function, we will overestimate luminance, andconsequently V will be too low.

This is true because the gamma function is roughly parabolic. Equally spacedsamples of a parabolic function yield equal maximum error of linearinterpolation in all intervals. The cost of tabulating _L[] rather than itsinverse is that we must search the table in order to find the largest _L[] lessthan or equal to L. The search time is minimized by using a search procedurethat begins the search at the place found by the last search, since successivecalls to LToV() are likely to request similar luminances.*/{	register luminanceTable *LT;	register int lo,hi,i;	register FIXED _dL,_dLTemp;	FIXED _V,_LLo;		LT=&LP->L;	if(LT->exists != luminanceSet){		/* get domain of the monotonic section of the gamma function */		LT->_VMin=DoubleToFix(LToVFormulaic(LP,LP->LMin));		LT->_VMax=DoubleToFix(LToVFormulaic(LP,LP->LMax));		LT->_dV=(LT->_VMax-LT->_VMin)/(LUMINANCES_IN_TABLE-1);		_V=LT->_VMin;		for(i=0;i<LUMINANCES_IN_TABLE;i++,_V+=LT->_dV) LT->_L[i]=_VToL(LP,_V);		/* just in case, impose monotonicity, from center on out */		for(i=LUMINANCES_IN_TABLE/2;i>0;i--)			if(LT->_L[i-1] > LT->_L[i]) LT->_L[i-1]=LT->_L[i];		for(i=1+LUMINANCES_IN_TABLE/2;i<LUMINANCES_IN_TABLE;i++)			if(LT->_L[i-1] > LT->_L[i]) LT->_L[i]=LT->_L[i-1];		#if FAST_LUMINANCE	/* compute the slope dL/dV */			/* find shift that maximizes ÆL precision without overflow */			_dL=0;			for(i=0;i<LUMINANCES_IN_TABLE-1;i++){				_dLTemp=LT->_L[i+1]-LT->_L[i];				if(_dL<_dLTemp)_dL=_dLTemp;			}			LT->LShift=Log2L(LONG_MAX/_dL);		#endif						LT->exists=luminanceSet;		LT->latestIndex=-2;	/* invalid, so hunt will start from scratch */	}	/* hunt for L in LT->_L[] */	/* first check at latestIndex, latestIndex±1, ... */	lo=-1;	hi=LUMINANCES_IN_TABLE;	i=LT->latestIndex;	if(i>lo && i<hi){		if(_L>LT->_L[i])			{lo=i;i++;}		else			{hi=i;i--;}	}	/* simple bisection search, see Numerical Recipes in C, pages 98-99. */	while(hi-lo>1){		i=(hi+lo)>>1;		if(_L>LT->_L[i])lo=i;		else hi=i;	}	LT->latestIndex=lo;	if(lo<0){		LT->latestIndex=0;			/* nearest legal index */		return LT->_VMin;	}	if(lo>=LUMINANCES_IN_TABLE-1)return LT->_VMax;	_LLo=LT->_L[lo];	_dL=_L-_LLo;	#if FAST_LUMINANCE		return LT->_VMin+lo*LT->_dV			+(_dL<<LT->LShift)/((LT->_L[lo+1]-_LLo<<LT->LShift)/LT->_dV);	#else		return LT->_VMin+LT->_dV*(lo+_dL/(LT->_L[lo+1]-_LLo));	#endif}double LToVFormulaic(luminanceRecord *LP,double L)/*Find a nominal voltage that would give luminance L.

First we find a quick approximate answer by solving the power lawfit, LToVPower(). Then we use Newton's method to home in quickly on the solutionto the polynomial fit. Newton's method is taken from Numerical Recipes in C. Fora polynomial of degree 8 (which is what I recommend) this routine now does about3? iterations and takes about 1.1? ms. The error in V is less than TOLERANCE,i.e. relative to full scale of 256 we get an accuracy of 14.6 bits. You canincrease the TOLERANCE to reduce the number of iterations to make it slightlyfaster. A TOLERANCE of 1.0 (for 8-bit accuracy) takes 0.8? ms, not much of asavings in time, and a large loss in accuracy. Reducing TOLERANCE to 1e-8 yieldsan accuracy of nearly 35 bits and takes 1.5? ms, only slightly longer.This routine will be called essentially once per clut entry, so computing awhole new clut with entries 0..255 will take 256*1.1? ms = 282? ms. Someexperiments use only part of the clut, and will therefore take less time. Insome of the experiments that do use the whole clut it may be desirable tocompute the clut table in advance.dgp 8/11/89*/{	#define TOLERANCE 0.01					/* desired accuracy of V, see above */	#define JMAX 20	double a[MAX_COEFFICIENTS];	register int i;	int m,j;	register double f,df,u,VV,V,dV;		if(L>LP->LMax) return LP->VMax;	if(L<LP->LMin) return LP->VMin;	m=LP->coefficients;	if(m>MAX_COEFFICIENTS || m<1)		PrintfExit("LToVPolynomial: %d coefficients is too many or too few\007\n",m);	for(i=0;i<m;i++) a[i]=LP->p[i];	a[0]-=L;	if(LP->powerError < 0.2*LP->LMax) V=LToVPower(LP,L);	/* very good initial guess */	else {		if(LP->quadraticError < 0.2*LP->LMax) V=LToVQuadratic(LP,L);/* fair initial guess */		else PrintfExit("LToVPolynomial: neither power nor quadratic fit is available\007\n");	}	for(j=0;j<JMAX;j++){		/* evaluate function, i.e. the polynomial, and its derivative */		f=a[0];		df=0.0;		VV=1.0;		for(i=1;i<m;i++){			u=a[i]*VV;			df+=i*u;			f+=V*u;			VV*=V;		}		dV=f/df;	/* apply Newton's method */		if(V-dV<LP->VMin) dV=(V-LP->VMin)/2.0;	/* bisect */		if(V-dV>LP->VMax) dV=(V-LP->VMax)/2.0;	/* bisect */		V -= dV;		if(fabs(dV) < TOLERANCE) return V;	}	printf("LToVPolynomial(%7.2f): Warning, too many iterations.
