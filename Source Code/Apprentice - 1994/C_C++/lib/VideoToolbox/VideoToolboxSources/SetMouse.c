/*SetMouse.cSets the mouse location to the given point, which is specified in the localcoordinate system of the current port.WARNING: In the Q & A Stack, Apple tells you how to do this, but warns that thetechnique uses undocumented low-memory locations that are considered unsupportedand volatile and may change in future CPUs.From "Code gadgets: Setting the mouse location", THINKin' CaP, 1(2):28-29, Fall 1990.Copyright © 1991 SPLAsh Resources.
