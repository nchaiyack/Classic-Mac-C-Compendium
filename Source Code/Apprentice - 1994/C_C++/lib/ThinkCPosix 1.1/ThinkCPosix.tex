Hardin ("hardin@mcc.com"), andGary J. Henderson ("gary@iscnvx.lmsc.lockheed.com")\section{Posix}The use of the term ``Posix'' may be misleading---%it is certainly not meant to imply that the functions satisfyany Posix standards(of which the author is largely ignorant).It is intended simply as a descriptionof the kind of functions included---%namely, those Posix functions not includedin the Think C ANSI or Unix libraries.Many of the functions(in particular those in the file "dummy.c")do no more than return an appropriate value,indicating success or failure, as deemed appropriate.\section{Compilation}To re-compile the library,the included project "Posix.$\pi$" can be used.Just choose the "Build Library" optionin the "Project" menu.The author has all the ANSI options turned on,as well as "Require prototypes".The 4-byte int option and 68020 code optionare turned off.\section{Usage}Any file using the library should\begin{verbatim}      #include "ThinkCPosix.h"\end{verbatim}The header ("*.h") files should be placed somewherein the Think C tree (ie below the Think C application).Whenever the "Posix" library is included,the Think C "MacTraps" library must also be included.(This could probably be avoided by abstractingthe very few MacTraps functions called.However, that is probably illegal?)\section{Notes}These are a few random thoughts on some of the functionsin the library.\begin{description}\item["alloca()"]This has been included to avoid duplication.Note that the prototype is "void *alloca(size_t)",rather than "char *alloca(unsigned)".\item["dup()"]The functions "dup()" and "dup2()"(as implemented here)both close the original file after duplication.The reason for this is that Think C adopts the non-standard,if plausible, policy of including some file-functions(such as "close")as part of the file structure.So a "close(fd)" addressed to the original descriptorwould also close the duplicate.(This may be a misunderstanding on the author's part.)\item["getpasswd()"]This (and one or two other functions)call "getlogin()" in the Think C Unix libraryto find the user's name.This latter must be set---%under System 7, at least---%in the "Sharing Setup" Control Panel,as described in the Macintosh Networking Reference manual.(I believe that under System 6 it was changedon the Chooser panel.)\item["Open()"]The library includes a few ``substitute'' functions,eg "Perror()" and "Open()".The idea is that these can be used in place of"perror()" or "open()" by including eg the line\begin{verbatim}      #define open Open\end{verbatim}at a judicious point in the program(probably at the end of the configuration file,"conf.h" or whatever).The function "Open(char*, int, ...)"allows "open()" to take more than 2 arguments(as seems increasingly the practice),although these extra arguments are ignored.\item["Perror()"]This gives a brief description of the error (if it can)rather than just the number as in "perror()".The Think C function "strerror()"---%which the author had not noticed---%may render this unnecessary.\end{description}\section{Development}Tha author would be very gratefulfor any suggested improvements or extensions.Please send them to "tim@maths.tcd.ie".Any material used will be duly acknowledged.Implementation of functions related to "pipe", "exec" and "spawn"would be particularly useful.(The "exec()" function in the Think C Unix libraryignores all arguments except for the application to be launched.It would be nice---and must surely be feasible---if these arguments could be properly passed.)\end{document}
