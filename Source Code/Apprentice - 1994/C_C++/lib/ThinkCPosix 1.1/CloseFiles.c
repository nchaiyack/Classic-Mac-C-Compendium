/* * This version of MF allows a number of .mf files to be processed successively, * taking advantage of a facility introduced by Knuth -- * but rarely if ever used nowadays -- * to run TeX or MF from core-dumps already initialized. * * Unfortunately, for some reason I have been unable to establish, * MF does not always close all its open files. * The number of open files builds up on successive runs, * until finally the number exceeds the maximum allowable. * * This little Think C function closes all open files. */#include <stdio.h> void closeallfiles(void); void closeallfiles(void){  int fd;    for (fd = 4; fd <= FOPEN_MAX; fd++)    if (__file[fd].refnum)      fclose(&__file[fd]);}
