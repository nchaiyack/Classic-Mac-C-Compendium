That's when Irealized that I could really use a log file to track what was going on with the app.  So I created this one.	It is simply a set of routines to open and write to a log file in the system folder.  Actually, theroutine is set up to store the log in one of two places-the Preferences folder, or a folder of yourdesire within the Preferences folder.==========Function Description==========	The functions are pretty simple, although you are required to include at least the "ansi-small"library.	Boolean InitLog(Str255 fold,short* vref,long* pid,long* fid);	InitLog should be called pretty early (I do it where after initializing the toolbox).  It locates thePreferences folder in the system folder.  If you also give a name to 'fold', then the function will alsofind the directory id for that folder (InitLog will create the folder if it doesn't already exist).short OpenLog(Str255 name,short vref,long did);	OpenLog opens the log file with name 'name' and returns the file reference number.  This is thenumber that is used in the rest of the functions.  A -1 is returned if there is an error.Boolean Log(short,const char* fmt,...);Boolean LogTime(short,const char* fmt,...);	These two functions work like fprintf.  LogTime precedes the string that is going to print withthe current date and time.void CloseLog(short);	This function closes the log file.==========Usage==========	The following is a very simple program which demonstrates how to use the log routines for twodifferent log files.	void main(){	short vref; /* vol ref num */	long pdir,fdir; /* preferences folder id, and my folder id */	short fref1,fref2; /* file reference number */		InitMacintosh(); /* init the mac toolbox */	if (InitLog("\pTest Log ƒ",&vref,&pdir,&fdir)){ /* then we are set to continue... */				fref1=OpenLog("\pLog File #1",vref,pdir); /* open a log file in the prefs folder */		fref2=OpenLog("\pLog File #2",vref,fdir); /* open a log file in our created folder */				if ((fref1!=-1)&&(fref2!=-1)){ /* then we can start logging */					LogTime(fref1,"Demo Log Program Open. %c",kNewLine); /* \n is not good for some editors... */			Log(fref1,"Welcome. %c%c",kNewLine,kNewLine);						LogTime(fref2,"Shutting down now... %c",kNewLine);						CloseLog(fref1);			CloseLog(fref2);		}	}}==========Finalè==========	Last but not least is the stuff the lawyers just love: use this at your own risk, I am not responsible,	no warrantee is implied, etc.  However, I am more than happy to discuss any problems that you might	have with this source.
