! Read Me (Dragons)Dragonsmith 1.1.1This folder contains three "dragons" created by Paul Hoffman using the Dragonsmith development kit, version 1.1.1File Paths---------This dragon will copy the full pathname (or just the name, if you want) of anything dropped on it to the clipboard.  It comes in mighty handy in MPW and some other development utilities.  There are several useful options.File Cleaver-----------This dragon splits text files into smaller parts.  You specify how to split the files and it does all the work.NOTE: File Cleaver is still in development.  Some capabilities are not enabled.Passer------This dragon can be used to send 'odoc' events to other processes.  Start your dragon in the THINK C Debugger and specify it as Passer's target.  Thereafter, any 'odoc' events received by Passer will be immediately passed on to your dragon.Passer can also be used to enable applications (like Microsoft Word) to open files they wouldn't normally be able to open.  Use this feature with great care -- some applications don't check the file type when they're asked to open something, and choke on files of the wrong type.Each of these applications is Copyright © 1992Ð1994 by Paul M.
