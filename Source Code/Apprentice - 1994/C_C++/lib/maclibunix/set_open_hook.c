/* A procedure to install a hook in the MPW C 'open' library function.
   This is useful because you may want to create files automatically
   with type 'TEXT' without having to change all the 'open' or 'fopen'
   calls in a large C program you are trying to port.  A standard hook
   procedure for this purpose is also provided.   

   Call:
   	set_open_hook(proc);
   This installs the hook proc, or restores the default situation if
   proc is NULL.
   The hook procedure will be called immediately *after* a successful
   open call, with the following parameters:
   	proc(filename, oflag, fd)
		char *filename;		The file name
		int oflag;		Mode passed to open
		int fd;			Return value from open

   Note: this only works when the program is linked as an application
   (type APPL); for tools (type MPST) the device switch is located
   in the Shell's memory.
   
   Careful! this information was gathered by disassembling parts
   of the library.
   There are no guarantees that the same code will work in future
   versions of MPW.  It has been tested with versions 1.0B2 through 2.01.
