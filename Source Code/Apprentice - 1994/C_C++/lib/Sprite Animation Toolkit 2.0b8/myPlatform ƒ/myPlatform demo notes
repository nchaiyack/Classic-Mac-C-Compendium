myPlatform demo notes

This demo demonstrates the following things:

¥ Collision handling again
¥ Using patterns instead of PICTs for the background
¥ Using faceless sprites, in this case static platforms
¥ Using "layer" for sorting (in order to make the man appear on top of the moving platforms)
¥ Simple keyboard controls

The demo looks a bit like a platform game, but it is *not* a working game at all.

Note: I am not sure this demo will survive. It is pretty new, so it may have bugs, redundant code, etc. I will probably revise it altogether later, or scrap it, but I wanted you to see some possibilities that some recent changes give.

Its old name was SplATform, in case you find that name somewhere.
