SAT 2.0b6 notes
===============

Sixth beta - New Year Revision.

Changes this time (lots of them):

¥ Faster 1-bit graphics, takes more memory. Havn't evaluated how much faster it got yet, though.
¥ Offscreens use less memory.
¥ Any sprite size is permitted: bigger than 64*64 and with widths not divisible by 8.
¥ The library was split into two. It's too big to fit in one nowadays.
¥ Sound errors are now reported to a procedure of your choice, or ignored.
¥ New system for making faces, in order to let you load pictures from any source you want.
¥ InitSAT and CustomInitSAT don't return WindowPtrs any more. Use gSAT.wind instead.
¥ Cleanup in demos, esp SAT Invaders.
¥ Configurable strings, so you can make programs in other languages.
¥ Support for scrolling games. Preliminary scrolling demo: Zkrolly.
¥ Preliminary C versions of SATInvaders and (SAT)Collision.
¥ Initializing with a preloaded window works better (that is at all).
¥ Global variables now in a record.

Users of 2.0b5 must make the following changes:
¥ Change your calls to InitSAT and CustomInitSAT. If your old call was

myWind := InitSAT(É);

change it to

InitSAT(É);
myWind := gSAT.wind;

or remove myWind altogether. If you use CustomInitSAT, you must add a boolean parameter. (The value "true" is recommended.)
¥ If you use a synch procedure, declare it as a function, not a procedure. (In C: pascal Boolean rather than pascal void.) It should usually return false.
¥ Remove SAT.lib from your projects and replace it with both SAT1.lib and SAT2.lib. (In C: SAT1.¹ and SAT2.¹.)
¥ Rename appropriate references to global variables (SATwind to gSAT.wind, ourDepth to gSAT.initDepth, offSizeH to gSAT.offSizeH).

Known problems:

¥ How on earth do you make Think C 6 accept my libraries? Think C 5 is ok (but was poorly documented). I don't have Think C 6, so I can't tell if the problems that have been reported are due to bugs on Symantec's part, or that the people trying to use SAT with it can't find or use the object code converter.
¥ SAT on second screen demands same depth on 1st and 2nd screen.
