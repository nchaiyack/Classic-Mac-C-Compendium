//¥ C translation from Pascal source file: soundConst.p//¥ =================================================.//¥ ============= Sound Constants and handles ==============.//¥ =================================================.//¥ Example file for Ingemars Sprite Animation Toolkit.//¥ © Ingemar Ragnemalm 1992.//¥ See doc files for legal terms for using this code.//¥ This file defines handles for your sound resources. The procedure LoadSounds.//¥ is called at startup. It calls the sound units for each sound to preload. Note that.//¥ merely loading the sound is not enough if the sound unit decides to use Sound Driver.//¥ When designing your game, my advice to you is to use sounds, several sounds,.//¥ but not ridiculously many and large. A simplistic game that takes 1000k on disk.//¥ just because it contains lots of sounds is just a waste of disk (and we have seen.//¥ far too many of them on the shareware market), but a well-polished, complex.//¥ and interesting game can and should use more.//¥ SoundConst; I know, bad name for the unit, nowadays.//¥ Prototypes, etc.#include "SAT.h"Handle toffH, dunkH, piuH, kraschH;void LoadSounds (){	toffH = SATGetNamedSound ("\ptoff");	dunkH = SATGetNamedSound ("\pDunk");	piuH = SATGetNamedSound ("\ppiu");	kraschH = SATGetNamedSound ("\pKrasch 1");}
