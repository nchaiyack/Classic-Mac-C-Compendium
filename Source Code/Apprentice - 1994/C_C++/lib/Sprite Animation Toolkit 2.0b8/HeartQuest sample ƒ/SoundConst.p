The procedure LoadSounds is called at startup. It calls}{ the sound units for each sound to preload. Note that merely loading the sound}{ is not enough if the sound units decide to use Sound Driver. }{ When designing your game, my advice to you is to use sounds, several sounds,}{ but not ridiculously many and large. A simplistic game that takes 1000k on disk}{ just because it contains lots of sounds is just a waste of disk (and we have seen}{ far too many of them on the shareware market), but a well-polished, complex}{ and interesting game can use more. }unit SoundConst;interface	uses		SAT;	const		Splatt2Snd = 14315;		Splatt3Snd = 20039;		KlounkSnd = 21999;		plinkSnd = 10873;		sadarSnd = 25626;		jaSnd = 3024;	var		Splatt2SndH, Splatt3SndH, KlounkSndH: handle;		plinkSndH, sadarSndH, jaSndH, TickSndH: handle;	procedure LoadSounds;implementation	procedure LoadSounds;	begin		Splatt2SndH := SATGetSound(Splatt2Snd);		Splatt3SndH := SATGetSound(Splatt3Snd);		KlounkSndH := SATGetSound(KlounkSnd);		PlinkSndH := SATGetSound(PlinkSnd);		SadarSndH := SATGetSound(SadarSnd);		JaSndH := SATGetSound(JaSnd);		TickSndH := SATGetNamedSound('tick');{Why I'm using SATGetSound most of the time but SATGetNamedSound for the last one?}{Because I started using resource id's, but later decided that the names are the "right"}{way to get sounds!
