HeartQuest as SAT demo
======================

HeartQuest is the biggest demo in SAT. This obviously makes it hardest to grasp, but it includes a bunch of useful routines that you may need, including:

¥ Menu and window handling, using the TransSkel package.
¥ A score and level display, updated using SAT's background modification functions.
¥ High score list.
¥ Crystal Quest-style mouse control using fixed-point numbers. (Note: never use floating point in an arcade game!)
¥ Optionally zooms to fill the entire screen (though the sprites stay the same size).
¥ Dithered background generated on-line by QuickDraw calls.
¥ Centering dialogs.
¥ Preference file in the appropriate place in the system folder.
¥ Uses SATSetStrings to make it possible to localize without recompiling.

Binary not included, since it will be distributed separately.
