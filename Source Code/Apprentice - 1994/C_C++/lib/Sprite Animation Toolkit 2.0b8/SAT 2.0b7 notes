SAT 2.0b7 notes==============Compared to 2.0b6, this is a small revision. Most of you won't notice the differences.¥ The new 1-bit graphics is gone, reverted to something close to the old system. The new (2.0b6) b/w graphics wasn't noticeably faster than the old system, took 8 times as much space and took forever to load on old Macs.¥ Minor speed optimizations.¥ Fixed a bug or two in loading to an existing window.¥ Fixed some of the problems with using a second screen. Some problems remain. If you do use SAT on a 2nd screen, make sure to save the device. SetGDevice(GetMainDevice) might help.
