This demo is not a framework around which todevelop an application, but rather a demo of the mechanics of usinga "floating" editor and using BecomeGopher().	To run this demo	1)	Add EditCellDemo.c and EditCellDemo.rsrc files to a new segment of 	the Showcase Application (v 1.2a or later).		2)	Compile and Run.
