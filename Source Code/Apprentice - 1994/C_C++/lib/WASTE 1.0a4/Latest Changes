Changes from version 1.0a3:


Library file renamed

“WASTE.Lib” has been renamed to “WASTE.o” to make it clear that it’s in MPW .o format.

Change in distribution policy

Starting from this release, the WASTE package contains the source code for the library itself and can be freely distributed electronically.

No more all-uppercase routine names

The names of some routines in previous versions of WASTE were all-uppercase, contrary to the definitions in the C header files, causing some link problems.  I hope I fixed this problem in the included .o file.

Bugs Fixed

* Fixed a bug in WEPaste that would cause a bogus error code to be returned if the scrap contained a TEXT or styl item larger than 32,767 bytes.

* WASTE 1.0a3 would sometimes allocate offscreen buffers much larger than necessary and even crash your application if you set the destination rectangle to a rectangle wider than 8,191 pixels.  I hope this bug has been fixed.
