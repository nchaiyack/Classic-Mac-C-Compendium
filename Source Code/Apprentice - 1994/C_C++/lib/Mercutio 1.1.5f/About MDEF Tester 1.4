 MDEFTester 1.4 is a development tool to test out custom menu definition procedures. It allows you to test MDEFs from a common central environment. MDEFTester is particularly useful for MDEFs that are similar to the standard MDEF. When you start MDEFTester, you'll see a two menus, one called "B/W" (for Black and White) and one called "Color". They demonstrate pretty much all of the features of the menu manager (disabled items, icon items, styled items, hierarchical menus, separators, colored items, etc…). You can test your MDEF by "attaching" it it to the program using "Attach MDEF file…" under the File menu. This allows you to open the resource fork of any given file.The file you open should contain your compiled MDEF resource with an ID of 1. MDEFTester will then switch both the B/W and the Color menu over to been driven by this custom MDEF. To compare between the system MDEF and your custom MDEF, use the “Toggle” item in the File menu. • 1/20/93 : 1.4- Adds support for testing PopUpMessage.• 10/2/92 : 1.3- Switched metaphor: toggles one set of menus between standard and custom MDEF rather than having several sets of menus.• 7/29/92 : 1.2.5- First public release.- List uses custom LDEF.• 6/6/92 : 1.1- Added window with list to record user actions. MDEFTester is freeware but not public domain. It may be copied and distributed freely as long as no modifications are made to it and nothing is charged for it. As always, feedback, comments and bug reports are happily accepted. I will try to fix bugs as soon as I get them, and will try to support whatever features people request in subsequent releases of MDEFTester.
