I have tried to be careful to set the tests up	so that they are equally fair to Thread Library and to Thread	Manager.		The most important aspect of efficiency for threads is the speed of	context switches. Other thread operations are usually done only	occasionally. For instance, the time spent in the routines used to	allocate and dispose of threads tends to be much less than the time	spent executing threads, and the number of calls to create and	dispose of threads also tends to be much smaller than the number	of calls to the context switching routines. Thus, a test program	that is used to measure the speed of an implementation of threads would	do best to measure the speed of context switches.		Context switches in Thread Library are accomplished using the routine	ThreadYield, while most context switches using Thread Manager would	be done using the routine YieldToAnyThread. To measure the relative speed	of context switches, this program sets up several threads. Each thread	runs in an infinite loop, in each iteration of which a global counter is	incremented and then the appropriate context switching routine is called.	The threads are executed for a predetermined time; when the time has	elapsed, the threads are all disposed of. The greater the number of context	switches that were accomplished during the run time, the larger the value	the counter will have reached. Thus, we can determine which implementation	has a shorter scheduling and context switching time by comparing the maximum	values of the counters. For comparison, a test using a fairly simple "for"	loop is run to determine the approximate maximum theoretical value that the	counter could reach if the context switch time were zero.		Usually threads will do more than these simple test threads, so the time	spent in context switches will be a smaller portion of the total time spent	in the program. It is still better, however, to have a faster context	switch time.		The following output was produced on 94/03/01 on a Macintosh Plus running	System 7.0 and Thread Manager 1.2. All other extensions were disabled.	The only other open application was Finder 7.0. Thread Library 1.0d3	was used in the tests. All optimizations and smart link were enabled,	and all debug code was disabled (by defining NDEBUG) when the test	program and Thread Library were compiled using THINK C 5.0.4. The	program executed as an application (which is faster than running under	the THINK C debugger).		Thread Library: count = 135377 (ThreadYield was called 143839 times)		Thread Manager: count = 52704 (YieldToAnyThread was called 55998 times)		No threads: count = 4043808	In these tests, Thread Library is about 2.6 times faster than Thread	Manager. The approximate maximum possible count value is 4043808, so	the efficiency of Thread Library is about 3.3% of that of a simple	loop, while the efficiency of Thread Manager is about 1.3% of the	efficiency of the same loop.			The first time I compared Thread Library to Thread Manager, I was	surprised to find that Thread Library was at least 32% faster than	Thread Manager. After some performance tuning, Thread Library is	now 2 to 3 times faster than Thread Manager. If even this is too slow,	you could modify Thread Library to be even more efficient, perhaps by	coding critical sections in assembly language. In contrast, Apple's	Thread Manager can not be modified by the end user. One would expect	an operating system function produced by Apple to be at least competitive	in its speed, but for some reason Thread Manager is quite slow.		94/03/01 aih - removed test for system version					 - updated results	94/02/18 aih - errors are reported using printf instead of DebugStr	94/02/17 aih - release 1.0d2					 - made Thread Library faster	94/02/15 aih - added comparison with Thread Manager					 - added big header comment	94/02/13 aih - created */#ifdef THINK_C	#include <MacHeaders>	#include <console.h>#endif#include <limits.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <string.h>#include <GestaltEqu.h>#include <Threads.h>#include "ThreadLib.h"#define NTESTS		(3)		/* number of tests executed */#define NTHREADS	(16)		/* number of threads to create */#define RUNSECS	(60L)		/* number of seconds to run each test */#define RUNTICKS	(RUNSECS * THREAD_TICKS_SEC)	/* time to run threads *//* data passed to threads */typedef struct {	long yield;					/* number of times yield function was called */	long count;					/* counter incremented every time a thread is run */} ThreadDataType;/* initialize application heap */static void HeapInit(long stack, short masters){	SetApplLimit(GetApplLimit() - stack);	MaxApplZone();	while (masters-- > 0)		MoreMasters();}/* initialize managers */static void ManagersInit(void){	EventRecord event;	short i;		/* standard initializations */	InitGraf((Ptr) &thePort);	InitFonts();	InitWindows();	InitMenus();	TEInit();	InitDialogs(NULL);	FlushEvents(everyEvent, 0);	InitCursor();		/* so first window will be frontmost */	for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)		EventAvail(everyEvent, &event);}/* print an error message and die */static void fatal(const char *msg, OSErr err){	printf("Fatal error #%d: %s.\n", err, msg);	ExitToShell();}/* a simple thread that uses Thread Library */static void tl_thread(void *data){	register ThreadDataType *td = data;		for (;;) {		td->count++;		td->yield++;		ThreadYield(0);	}}/* a simple thread that uses Thread Manager */static pascal void *tm_thread(void *data){	register ThreadDataType *td = data;		for (;;) {		td->count++;		td->yield++;		YieldToAnyThread();	}	return(NULL);}/* a very simple non-thread that does approximately the same thing as	the threads */static long nt_thread(void){	EventRecord event;	ThreadTicksType nextEvent;	ThreadTicksType stop;	long count;	short i;	/* run for a predetermined number of ticks */	count = 0;	nextEvent = 0;	stop = TickCount() + RUNTICKS;	while (TickCount() < stop) {			/* periodically discard all pending events */		if (TickCount() >= nextEvent) {			while (GetNextEvent(everyEvent, &event))				;			nextEvent = TickCount() + THREAD_TICKS_SEC;		}		/* simulate the action of several threads, but without the overhead of			the thread dispatcher */		for (i = 0; i < NTHREADS; i++)			count++;	}	return(count);}/* test ThreadLib */static void tl_test(void){	ThreadType threads[NTHREADS];	ThreadDataType td;	EventRecord event;	ThreadTicksType nextEvent;	ThreadTicksType stop;	short i;		printf("\nTesting Thread Library.
