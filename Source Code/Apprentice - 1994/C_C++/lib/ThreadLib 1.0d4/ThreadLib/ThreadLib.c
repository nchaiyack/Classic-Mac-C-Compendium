(while no						stack is allocated for the main thread, the main thread						is created very early in the application and usually						remains in existence until the application exits.)					 - limited release 1.0d1.1	94/02/11 aih - added thread status field	94/02/10 aih - release 1.0d1; got threads to work without crashing! yay! :-)	94/02/04 aih - created *//*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*//* include statements *//*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/#include <setjmp.h>#include <Events.h>#include <Memory.h>#include <OSUtils.h>#include "ThreadLib.h"/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*//* compiler-specific code *//*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/#if ! defined(THINK_C) || THINK_C != 5	/* The register ordering within the jmp_buf type is compiler dependent.		It should be straightforward to modify this for MPW, and less so		for a native PowerPC version (though perhaps still possible).

You	should call ThreadEnd, passing it the thread returned by ThreadBeginMain,	before exiting your application.	- The main thread uses the application's stack and context; no private	stack is allocated for the main thread.

The 'entry' parameter is a pointer to a function that is	called to start executing the thread. The 'suspend' parameter is a pointer	to a function called whenever the thread is suspended.

You can use the 'resume' function to	restore additional application defined context for the thread. The	'data' parameter is passed to the 'entry', 'suspend', and 'resume'	functions and may contain any application defined data.		The 'stack_size' parameter specifies the size of the stack needed by	the thread. The requested stack size should be large enough to contain	all function calls, local variables and parameters, and any operating	system routines that may be called while the thread is active (including	interrupt driven routines). If 'stack_size' is zero then the default	stack size returned by ThreadStackDefault is used. It is a good idea to	set the stack size to at least the value returned by ThreadStackMinimum;	otherwise, your application is likely to crash somewhere inside the	operating system. If your thread crashes try increasing the thread's stack	size. You can enable the stack sniffer VBL task (see Stack Sniffer above)	to help detect insufficient stack space. In addition, a stack overflow	will often result in a corrupted heap, since the stack is allocated as	a nonrelocatable block in the heap and overflow usually overwrites the	block's header. For this reason, you can often detect stack overflow by	enabling a "heap check" option in a low-level debugger such as TMON or	MacsBug.		The new thread is appended to the end of the thread queue, making it	eligible for scheduling whenever ThreadYield is called.
