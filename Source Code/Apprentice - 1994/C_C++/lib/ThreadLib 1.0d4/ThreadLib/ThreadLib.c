/*	ThreadLib implements nonpreemptive multiple thread execution within
	a single application.

	94/03/16 aih - changed ThreadType to ThreadStructure, and ThreadSNType
						to ThreadType.
	94/03/11 aih - made gThread and gStackSniffer static variables
	94/03/09 aih - in v1.0d3 i wrote the stack sniffer sentinel value right over
						the heap zone information for the application heap. this of
						course resulted in a damaged heap. what a stupid mistake.
						now the main thread doesn't use a stack sniffer sentinel
						value, but all other threads still use the stack sniffer
						sentinel value.
	94/03/?? aih - release 1.0d3
	94/02/28 aih - fixed error in setting thread error code in ThreadFromSN
					 - added sentinel value to stack sniffer VBL task
	94/02/25 aih - will compile with either "LoMem.h" or "SysEqu.h"
	94/02/23 aih - fixed an error in the private routine ThreadStackFrame
	94/02/19 aih - added ThreadSleepSet, ThreadData, ThreadDataSet
					 - added doubly-linked list circular queue of threads
					 - all external functions refer to threads using thread serial
					 	numbers instead of thread pointers
					 - when a thread is activated it is moved to the end of the
					 	queue of threads, so that the round-robbin scheduling is
					 	fairer (since the main thread has the highest priority).
	94/02/18 aih - release 1.0d2.1
					 - to reduce the possibility of conflict with user-defined types,
					 	uses ThreadTicksType instead of TicksType, THREAD_TICKS_MAX
					 	instead of TICKS_MAX, and THREAD_TICKS_SEC instead of
					 	TICKS_SEC
					 - includes actual headers instead of using THINK C's
					 	non-standard MacHeaders. this was done primarily so I
					 	could use "SysEqu.h" instead of "LoMem.h", but it will
					 	also make porting to another compiler easier.
					 - added THREAD_DEBUG so thread debug code can be selectively
					 	disabled without defining NDEBUG and surrounded debug
					 	functions with conditional compile directives to reduce
					 	dead-code size in non-debug version
					 - uses the OS routines Enqueue and Dequeue instead of my
					 	own linked-list code. this made the code cleaner and will
					 	make the object code even more compact.
					 - made defines with prefix "LM" for all low-memory globals
	94/02/17 aih - put back THREAD_SET_GLOBALS code in attempt to fix
						update problems
	94/02/17 aih - added string to assertion debug statement, and added ifdef
					 	around assertfailed function to keep it from being compiled
					 	into non-debug version
	94/02/17 aih - release 1.0d2
					 - for efficiency, defined TickCount as Ticks low-memory global
					 - for greater ease in adding ThreadLib to other people's
						applications, removed use of exceptions. this also increases
						the efficiency of context switches in applications that
						don't use exceptions
	94/02/15 aih - removed THREAD_SET_GLOBALS code since it didn't seem to be
						needed
	94/02/14 aih - added thread serial numbers
					 - added precondition for ThreadEnd
					 - fixed problem with defer and combine stack adjusts
	94/02/13 aih - added stack sniffer VBL task
					 - added functions for determining the minimum and the default
					 	stack sizes for threads and removed THREAD_STACK_SIZE
	94/02/12 aih - made threads use pointers instead of handles. using pointers
						increases the efficiency of the thread library. this won't
						significantly increase memory fragmentation since stacks
						for threads are already allocated as pointers. (while no
						stack is allocated for the main thread, the main thread
						is created very early in the application and usually
						remains in existence until the application exits.)
					 - limited release 1.0d1.1
	94/02/11 aih - added thread status field
	94/02/10 aih - release 1.0d1; got threads to work without crashing! yay! :-)
	94/02/04 aih - created */

		MPW and later versions of THINK C you should check the "setjmp.h" header
		file for the definition of jmp_buf and also check the instructions used to

		compiler, you can enable the optimizations. If it then crashes,
		you'll know that one or more of the optimizations performed by

	The 'stack_size' parameter specifies the size of the stack needed by
	the thread. The requested stack size should be large enough to contain
	all function calls, local variables and parameters, and any operating
	system routines that may be called while the thread is active (including
