This is STDWIN 0.9.8, a minor update.--Guido van Rossum, CWI, Amsterdam <Guido.van.Rossum@cwi.nl>(30 July 1993)------------------------------------------------------------------------I am glad to announce that STDWIN version 0.9.8 is now available foranonymous ftp.I have placed a copy of the tar image named stdwin0.9.8.tar.Z on theftp server ftp.cwi.nl (IP address 192.16.184.180) in directory pub.If you don't have ftp access, send mail containing only the word HELPto ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and theserver will send you instructions on how to make requests.What's New in STDWIN 0.9.8==========================- bitmap support (not yet in the Mac version)- wsetfont returns an error instead of printing a message- wlistfontnames (dummy in the Mac version)- wsetwinpos, wsetwinsize (dummy in the Mac version)What's New in STDWIN 0.9.7==========================This release is a temporary measure, needed primarily to support theupcoming release 0.9.7 of the Python programming language.  It isstill lacking complete and up-to-date documentation.  (Sigh!)Changes with respect to 0.9.6:- new drawing functions:  - wfillcircle(int h, int v, int radius)  - wxorcircle(int h, int v, int radius)  - wfillelarc(int h, int v, int hrad, int vrad, int ang1, int ang2)  - wxorelarc(int h, int v, int hrad, int vrad, int ang1, int ang2)  - wdrawpoly(int n, short points[n])  - wfillpoly(int n, short points[n])  - wxorpoly(int n, short points[n])- Meta keys are now reported as WE_KEY events instead of being ignored,  if they aren't menu shortcuts- new functions in the X11 version only:  - wgetxwindowid(WINDOW *w) returns the X11 window id of a window  - wconnectionnumber() returns the X11 connection number (a file    selector usable in BSD select())- Ported the Mac version to Think C 5.0- The alfa version doesn't crash any more when you press ^G- the print menu in dpv is more easily customizable- the miniedit demo now displays a watch cursor when it is busy- mods for porting to AIX- use str(r)chr instead of (r)index everywhere (or at least in more places)What's New in STDWIN 0.9.6==========================This release is a temporary measure, needed primarily to support theupcoming release 0.9.2 of the Python programming language.  It isstill lacking complete and up-to-date documentation.For those who are familiar with STDWIN 0.9.5, here is a summary of themain changes in version 0.9.6 (of course, a number of bugs were alsofixed).- Initialization is now separated in argument processing and actual  initialization.- Scroll bars can be turned off with an option at window creation time.- More inquiry functions, e.g., document size, window position.- Filled and XOR mode drawing of circles and elliptical arcs.- Polygon drawing (filled, outline and XOR).- Color drawing.- Modifier keys (control, shift, meta etc.) are passed in mouse events.- Closing a window is now indicated by a separate event, WE_CLOSE.- New event type WE_KEY reports non-ASCII keys and keys with modifiers.To refresh your memory, here's a little blurb on STDWIN:What Is STDWIN==============STDWIN (STanDard Window INterface -- in analogy to STDIO) is a simplewindowing interface for C programs, that is implemented on variousplatforms.  The "flagship" implementations support the Macintosh andX11 windowing environments.  The emphasis is on portability betweenplatforms and a simple interface to the application, not on gettingthe maximum performance or functionality of one particular platform.For a longer introduction, read the (still outdated) file Doc/ABOUT.For more information on the Macintosh version, read Ports/mac/README.For MS-DOS, read Ports/msdos/README.Supported Platforms===================Currently, programs using STDWIN can be made to run on Unix under X11,on alphanumeric terminals (using termcap -- obviously with some lossof functionality), on the Apple Macintosh (using THINK C 4.0), or onMS-DOS with a dumb display (using Microsoft C).  I am working onpatches to get the Mac port running under MPW 3.x (which is quitedifferent in some respects from MPW 2.x); contact me if you need thisurgently.  If you insist, I also have two versions for the Atari ST(one for MWC and one for TurboC) that need a lot of dusting off, andhaven't been upgraded to all the lovely new features.Copyright=========Copyright 1988, 1989, 1991, 1992 by Stichting Mathematisch Centrum,Amsterdam, The Netherlands.                        All Rights ReservedPermission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice appear in all copies and thatboth that copyright notice and this permission notice appear in supporting documentation, and that the names of Stichting MathematischCentrum or CWI not be used in advertising or publicity pertaining todistribution of the software without specific, written prior permission.STICHTING MATHEMATISCH CENTRUM DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TOTHIS SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY ANDFITNESS, IN NO EVENT SHALL STICHTING MATHEMATISCH CENTRUM BE LIABLEFOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGESWHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER IN ANACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUTOF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.--Guido van Rossum, CWI, Amsterdam <guido@cwi.nl>
