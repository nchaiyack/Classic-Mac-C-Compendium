# Definitions pertaining to IBM R2 architecture

# Define the name of this architecture here.
# This is used as a subdirectory name where all the objects for this
# architecture live: $(TOP)/Build/$(ARCH)
#
# Note that there is the silent assumption that there is only one O.S.
# per architecture.  We'll have to invent composite architecture names,
# or insert an extra level in the build tree, if this becomes false...
