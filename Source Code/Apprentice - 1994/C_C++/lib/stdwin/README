STDWIN ESSENTIAL INFORMATION****************************[last edit: 30 July 1993]What Is STDWIN==============STDWIN (STanDard Window INterface -- similar to STDIO) is a simplewindowing interface for C programs, that is implemented on variousplatforms.  The "flagship" implementations support the Macintosh andX11 windowing environments.  The emphasis is on portability betweenplatforms and a simple interface to the application, not on gettingthe maximum performance or functionality of one particular platform.For a longer introduction, read the (still outdated) file Doc/ABOUT.For more information on the Macintosh version, read Ports/mac/README.For MS-DOS, read Ports/msdos/README.Supported Platforms===================Currently, programs using STDWIN can be made to run on Unix under X11,on alphanumeric terminals (using termcap -- obviously with some lossof functionality), on the Apple Macintosh (using THINK C 5.0), or onMS-DOS with a dumb display (using Microsoft C).  I am working onpatches to get the Mac port running under MPW 3.x (which is quitedifferent in some respects from MPW 2.x); contact me if you need thisurgently.  If you insist, I also have two versions for the Atari ST(one for MWC and one for TurboC) that need a lot of dusting off, andhaven't been upgraded to all the lovely new features.Copyright=========Copyright 1988, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1993 by Stichting MathematischCentrum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.                        All Rights ReservedPermission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its documentation for any purpose and without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice appear in all copies and thatboth that copyright notice and this permission notice appear in supporting documentation, and that the names of Stichting MathematischCentrum or CWI not be used in advertising or publicity pertaining todistribution of the software without specific, written prior permission.STICHTING MATHEMATISCH CENTRUM DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TOTHIS SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY ANDFITNESS, IN NO EVENT SHALL STICHTING MATHEMATISCH CENTRUM BE LIABLEFOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGESWHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER IN ANACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUTOF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.This is Version 0.9.8=====================I believe it is a mature product, except for the lack of completedocumentation.  When I have finished the manual I'll release version1.0, and post it to an appropriate comp.sources group.*** News since 0.9.7: bitmap support; wsetfont returns error;wlistfontnames; wsetwinpos, wsetwinsize.Where To Get STDWIN===================I have placed a copy of the tar image named stdwin0.9.8.tar.Z on theftp server ftp.cwi.nl (IP address 192.16.184.180) in directory pub.Don't forget to specify binary file transfer mode when transferringcompressed or tar files!  ("type binary")If you don't have ftp access, send mail containing only the word HELPto ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and theserver will send you instructions on how to make requests.Getting Started Right Now=========================For some common systems, the system knows how to configure itselfautomatically.  This works for:	Hardware			Operating System	DEC VAX, DECstation		Ultrix 2.2 or 3.0	Sun3, Sun4			SunOS 4.0 or 4.1	Silicon Graphics Personal IRIS	IRIX 3.2 or 3.3	Harris HCX-7 (tahoe)		BSD 4.3(For other OS versions on these or similar machines, give it a tryanyway, it may work as well, especially if there is a program called"arch" or "machine" that prints the machine type.)  To build STDWINfor X11 on such systems:	cd Conf	./mkmf				# answer all questions with yes	cd ..	cd Build/<arch>/x11/lib		# <arch> is `machine` or `arch`	makeThis creates the STDWIN library for X11 on a file named "lib.a".To build the standard test/demo application, "miniedit" (first chdirback to the top of the STDWIN source tree):	cd Conf	./mkmf miniedit	cd ..	cd Build/<arch>/x11/miniedit	makeTo try it out, use it to have a look at the Makefile:	miniedit MakefileIf It Doesn't Work Right Away=============================You may have to create new Makefile prototypes in subdirectory Conf, orfix the mkmf script there.The configuration system works as follows.  Sources and objects live inseparate directories.  There are no tools like "imake" nor nonstandardmake features like "VPATH" used.  Instead, all Makefiles are generatedby simple, easy-to-understand shell scripts living in Conf.  It ispossible to say "make" in any leaf subdirectory of Build.Read Conf/README for more information.The STDWIN source tree======================The STDWIN tree is organized as follows.  Starting from the top of thetree (where this README file lives), we have:	.		Top-level directory.	README		The file you are now reading.	H/		Public header files of STDWIN ports and			packages.  Stdwin applications should pass this			directory to the compiler in a "-I" option.	Tools/		Subroutines used by various ports and			applications; not STDWIN-specific.			(This has now been truncated to the bare			minimum.)	Gen/		(Almost) generic versions of some STDWIN			functions, used by more than one port.  (Some			are dummies that ignore the request or always			fail.)	Ports/		Source for various ports.			Note: not all subdirectories are distributed!	Ports/x11/	Port to X11 R4; uses Xlib only.	Ports/alfa/	Port for alphanumeric displays using termcap/terminfo.	Ports/vtrm/	VTRM (virtual terminal) package used by Ports/alfa.	Ports/atrm/	Amoeba support or verion for VTRM (old).	Ports/proto/	Dummy routines to start a new port (ancient).	Ports/stubs/	RPC-style stubs (ancient).	Ports/mg1/	Obsolete Whitechapel MG-1 port.	Ports/atari/	Atari ST port, for Mark Williams C compiler.	Ports/atari_turbo/	(Newer) Atari ST port, for TurboC.	Ports/mac/	Apple Macintosh port (both MPW and THINK C).	Ports/msdos/	MS-DOS port (uses the alfa port mostly).	(etc)	Packs/		Source for packages (libraries) on top of STDWIN.	Packs/textedit/	Standard text-editing package.	Packs/vt/	Virtual terminal package (needs some work).	packs/buttons/	Probably not useful, and broken.	Appls/		Source for test programs and real applications.	Appls/README	Read this for more information.	Doc/		Documentation for STDWIN and packages.			Unfortunately this is terribly out of date.	Doc/ABOUT	Blurb to be sent to prospective users.	Doc/paper.ms	The original paper (CWI report CS-R8817) (*troff -ms).	(etc)	Conf/		Configuration scripts and prototype Makefiles.	Conf/README	Read this before twiddling the configuration.	Conf/mkmf	Script to build Makefiles.	Conf/mkall	Script to build Makefiles for allo applications.	Conf/proto.*	Makefile fragments used by mkmf.	Conf/*		Scripts used by mkmf.	Build/		Contains subdirectories where the various			ports are built for various architectures.	Build/sun3/	Sun3 (680x0) under SunOS 4.1	Build/sun4/	Sun4 (SPARC) under SunOS 4.1	Build/sgi/	Silicon Graphics under IRIX 3.2	Build/mips/	DEC RISC architecture under Ultrix 3.0	Build/vax/	DEC VAX under Ultrix 2.2	(etc)--Guido van Rossum, CWI, Amsterdam <Guido.van.Rossum@cwi.nl>"The life of a Repo Man is always intense"
