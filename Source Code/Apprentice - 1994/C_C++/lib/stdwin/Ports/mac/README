Notes for the 0.9.7 release

This release has been fixed to work with Think C 5.0, and might also
work with MPW 3.2.  The notes below still apply, more or less.  Note:
the only file you need from the Gen directory is wtextbreak.c!


Using STDWIN on the Mac

This assumes THINK C 4.0.  I believe you can make it work for THINK C
3.0, check for the symbol THINK_C_3_0 (especially in H/stdwconf.h).
It also works for MPW 2.0, see ../mac_mpw.

Copy the files from the following directories to the Mac:
	H
	Tools
	Gen
	Ports/mac
	Packs/textedit
	Appls/miniedit (for testing)

Make two projects, stdwin.<pi> and textedit.<pi> (<pi> is the letter
pi, Option-p).  All of STDWIN together is too big for one segment, and
the textedit module is not used by all applications.

Project stdwin.<pi> receives all sources from Tools, Gen and
Ports/mac; textedit.<pi> receives those from Packs/textedit.

Turn off <MacHeaders>; the sources know exactly which files to include.
(To speed up compilation you can rename "macwin.h" and precompile it,
placing the output in "macwin.h".  This is completely optional.)

Compile the sources in each project.  Don't attempt to link.

To test, make a project miniedit.<pi> and add all sources from
Appls/miniedit.  Add the ANSI and MacTraps libraries and the
stdwin.<pi> and textedit.<pi> projects you just created.  (Probably
everything in its own segment.)  You now have a simple editor with
regular expression search facility.  Study the source to learn more
about using stdwin.

Good luck!
