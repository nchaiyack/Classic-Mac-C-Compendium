Sorry, there is no real STDWIN port for MS-DOS yet.  What you can is
to port the alfa version with the help of the file "vtrm.c" in this
directory, which is a substitute (using the MS-DOS console driver) for
the VTRM module used by the alfa version for all its tty I/O (the UNIX
version of vtrm.c is in ../vtrm).
