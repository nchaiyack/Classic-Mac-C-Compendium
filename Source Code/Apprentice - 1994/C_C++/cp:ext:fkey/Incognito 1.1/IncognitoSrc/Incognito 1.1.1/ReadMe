Hello again,This is version 1.1.1 of Incognito. The only change is to prevent a crash at shutdown on any mac, and most likely is related to the crash referred to below. If you were seeing crashes at PLstrcmp+4c, this one’s for you.ManuelPlease report any crashes, problems, etc. to me at either 70365, 1426 (compuserve) or veloso@husc.harvard.edu (internet). Thanks.-----------Hi there,Incognito 1.1 is the final (and hopefully last) version of Incognito. Some fixes were implemented that should prevent crashing on AV systems.Incognito is freeware; use it, don’t abuse it…or at least don’t hold me liable.Notes-----Incognito masks network types relative to the local machine. To configure incognito, first launch the program that has a type that you want to mask. Then, open the incognito control panel and click 'add' (or type the letter 'a'). A list of network types/objects will be presented. Click on the name/type that you want to mask, and click add (or hit cmd-a). You can also just double-click on a type.To make a mask effective, you must reboot your machine.how it works------------Every time something looks for or registers a network entity that contains any of the mask strings, the part of the entity that matches a mask is replaced with garbage strings. This masking only happens on the machine on which Incognito is installed; to get this effect network–wide, you must install Incognito (and the corresponding preferences file) on each machine.Questions, comments, bug reports, etc. can be sent to me at the following addresses:veloso@netcom.com70365.1426@compuserve.comNote that Incognito is freeware, and is freely distributable. Source is available on request, and probably will be available on mac.archive.umich.edu, the MACDEV forum on Compuserve, and (if they allow the submission) the AOL development forum.
