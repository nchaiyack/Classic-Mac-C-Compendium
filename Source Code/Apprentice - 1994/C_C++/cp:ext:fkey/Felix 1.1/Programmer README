Hi,

This is a freeware extension I wrote a year ago. It is supposed to help you open a file with any application - when you double-click
a file and hold the Control key, you get a dialog asking which app you want to use to open the file. It has some severe limitations,
though, so I dropped it.

However, it may be useful as a code sample to get newbies started on INIT/cdev programming. The thing is made up of three projects:
	Loader.π				The INIT code
	Code128.π			The patch code
	Felix cdev				The cdev interface code
	
Felix works by patching PBDTGetAPPL, which the Finder uses when trying to find the app corresponding to a given file. If the control
key is down, it uses StandardGetFile to prompt the user for another app instead of chainging to the regular PBDTGetAPPL routine.

There are a few things which this code doesn't do, or does in a wrong way:
	Patch/cdev communication			Completely inexistent. To do it, use Gestalt or the PPC Toolbox.
	INIT/Patch communication				Done by writing data into code, which is uncool. Today I would use Gestalt.
	Trap patching								Correct on 68K, but remember that it has changed on PowerPC.
	
Bottom line: this code is of poor quality. Keep that in mind, and feel free to improve on it.

Of course, you are free to use it in any way you want. I retain no rights on it. Happy patching!
