//////////////////	SmoothScroll 1.0////	by Steve Bushell//	python@world.std.com////	©1993 Steve Bushell - all rights reserved////////////////SmoothScroll is an INIT which patches the ScrollRect trap, changing it from an instant, jumpy scroll, to a smooth, flowing scroll. 	The degree of smoothness is based on a 'cnfg' resource stored in the INIT file itself.  The higher the long int in the 'cnfg' resource, the smoother the scrolling will be.  You should not set this number too high because the scrolling, although very smooth, can get very slow.  The patch is also optimized to adjust the scrolling based on the number of pixels it will be moving, and their depth.  The	more pixels it will be moving, the more jumpy the scrolling becomes.The inspiration for this INIT originally came from a VAX (yes, a VAX/VMS mainframe).  Years ago, while working on one of those dinosaurs, our terminals always had the option of changing the screen's scrolling into a smooth, flowing motion.  That's the one single thing I liked about using those systems, and I couldn't go any longer without giving my Mac the same wonderful smoothness.  If you're the type who reads a lot of text while on-line, this will make reading the scrolling text much less painful, because it just glides by instead of jumping line by line.SmoothScroll is free, and may be redistributed provided this file is distributed with it.  I retain all rights to SmoothScroll, however I accept no responsibility for anything that happens as a result of using SmoothScroll.
