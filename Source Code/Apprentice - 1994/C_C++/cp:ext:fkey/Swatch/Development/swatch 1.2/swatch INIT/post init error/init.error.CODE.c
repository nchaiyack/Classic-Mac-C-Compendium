This code lives within a small block in the	System Heap which we want to get rid of.  But it's not safe to	dispose of the very block you're calling from!  So, we create a	little bit of code in ToolScratch which does the dispose for us	and execute it last. **/			move.l		4(A7), A1			move.l		#ToolScratch, A0			move.l		A0, 4(A7)			move.l		#0x2040A01F, (A0)	; movea.l D0, A0  /   _DisposPtr			move.w		#0x4ED1, 4(A0)		; jmp (A1)			lea			main, A0			move.l		A0, D0				; Pascal clobbers A0 when returning	}}
