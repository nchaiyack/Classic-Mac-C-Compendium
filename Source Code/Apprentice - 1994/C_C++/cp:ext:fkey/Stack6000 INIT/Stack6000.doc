Stack6000 INITThe processor stack size on the 68000 class machines (Plus, SE, PB100, etc) is for some reason set too small (about 2k Hex) for major programs to run properly, resulting in errors of the form id=28.  This is most noticible with MacTCP programs such as "Mailstrom".  Setting the stack to the Mac II class default, 6000 Hex, fixes the problem.  As only 4k is lost to the OS, there is not much problem with lost RAM. The Init has been tested on several 68000 type machines, and several Mac II class machines (where it doesn't adjust the stack) with no problems.  The init uses no memory, just comes in at startup, adjusts the stack if necessary, and exits.  The startup icon indicates whether adjustment was required.  This INIT is free, with the author assuming no responsibility for problems.  Questions can be directed to:Chuck PliskeSeawell Microsystems[internet e-mail address: "chuckp@u.washington.edu"]
