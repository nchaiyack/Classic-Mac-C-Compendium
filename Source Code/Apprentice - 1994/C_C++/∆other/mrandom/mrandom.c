A call to initstate() or setstate() *   1. defines the location of the state array (rngstate in the code below); *   2. defines the length of the state array (32 words in the code below; *	other possibilities are 2, 8, 16, or 64 words); *   3. initializes several static variables to point at the state array *	(the indices j and k in the code below); *   4. defines the randomization algorithm (a linear congruential *	generator is used if the state array has length 2). * Additionally, initstate(seed) fills the state array with the output * of a linear congruential generator that is seeded with the given seed. * * Here is a disassembled and decompiled listing of random(), as * it would operate when initialized with my init_rng routine: * * long random() * { *   static int j=4, k=1; *   long r;    *   rngstate[j] += rngstate[k]; *   r = (rngstate[j]>>1) & 0x7fffffff; *   j++; *   if (j>31) j=1; *   k++; *   if (k>31) k=1; *   return(r); * } * * Note that j and k return to their original values after every 31 * calls to random().  This property allows me to write a restart_rng() * routine even though I can't read the values of j and k.  * * Also note that this is a very poor RNG algorithm if it is only * called once between successive setstate() calls.  In this pathological * case, each output of random() will differ from the prior random() output * by rngstate[1]/2 or rngstate[1]/2+1, mod 2^31-1.  Even in non-pathological * calling sequences the long-period property of an additive congruential * generator is only guaranteed if j and k always move through the array * in the manner shown.  Thus the need for counting random() calls * (or for writing your own time-optimized additive congruential generator). * * Finally, note that integer overflow is a frequent occurrence in * rngstate[k] += rngstate[j].  Thus random() could conceivably * behave differently on different machines. */extern double frandom (){  RNGcount1++; /* mod-billion counter */  if (RNGcount1 == BILLION) {    RNGcount1 = 0;    RNGcount2++; /* an overflow is unlikely in my lifetime */  }  return( (double) random()/MAXLONG );} /* end frandom *//* Generate a random integer, uniformly distributed in the range 0..m-1. * We use the most-significant bits of the result of a random() call, * although this may only marginally improve the quality of our output. * You may wish to rewrite this routine if you don't have hardware * floating point.
