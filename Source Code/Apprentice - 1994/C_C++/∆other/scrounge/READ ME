	This utility will grab all new news articles in the subscribed
	groups specified in your .newsrc file and output them in rnews
	format. Output is to the console. You can redirect it to a file,
	if you wish, by typing "scrounge > filename" or something similar.
	
	The.newsrc file is updated to reflect the newly scrounged articles.
	
	Change SPOOL_DIR to the location of the news spool files for your
	host. It's usually in the /usr/spool/news directory, but this is
	subject to change depending on how your host is configured. For my
	host, it's /news/spool.
	
	scrounge has been tested on various Unix hosts, from Suns to BSDI
	flavors. If it doesn't compile under 'cc', try 'gcc'. Your mileage
	may vary. Neither Paul Celestin nor Celestin Company is responsible
	for any damaged caused by using this source file. Compile and use
	it at your own risk.
	
	Restrictions: You may freely distribute this source file. However,
	please do not distribute modified versions, unless you place a note
	in the source file stating that it has been modified and by whom.
