/*	CWJumpTable - Written by Stefan Arentz, 17/03/94		This Macsbug extension dumps the Jump table of an application that was build with	CodeWarrior C/C++ or Pascal (for 68K of course). It seems that CodeWarrior doesn't	use the standard jump table as described in Inside Mac, so I wrote this dcmd.	Codewarrior is still under development, so things could change...		Happy Machacking,		 -- Stefan Arentz, arentz@knoware.nl	C CWJumpTable.c	Link {Libraries}dcmdGlue.a.o {Libraries}put.c.o CWJumpTable.c.o {Libraries}Runtime.o -o CWJumpTable	BuildDcmd CWJumpTable 400	Echo 'include "CWJumpTable";' | Rez -a -o "{systemFolder}Debugger Prefs"*/
