This is the GNU release of uuencode and uudecode.

These programs are used to encode binary data in a printable ASCII
format which may be safely sent through e-mail or other communication
channel which does not support the transmission of eight bit data.

This code is based closely on the BSD NET/2 distribution.  Therefore,
it is covered by the BSD license, rather than the GPL.  See the
individual files for the copying conditions.

There is currently no texinfo documentation.  There are a couple of
man pages based on the Berkeley sources.

Please report any bugs to bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu.
