	  This program uses error correcting protocols to receive
	  files	over a dial-in serial port from	a variety of programs
	  running under	PC-DOS,	CP/M, Unix, and	other operating
	  systems.  It is invoked from a shell prompt manually,	or
	  automatically	as a result of an "sz file ..."	command	given
	  to the calling program.

	  This program is not designed to be called from _c_u(_1),
	  _t_i_p(_1), or other communications programs.  Unix flavors of
	  Omen Technology's Professional-YAM communications software
	  are available	for dial-out applications.  Unix
	  Professional-YAM supports dial-out applications with
	  telephone directory, a powerful script language with learn
	  function, high quality multiple protocol support, and	UUCP
	  port arbitration.


	  RRRRzzzz (Receive ZMODEM) receives one or more files with the
	  ZMODEM protocol.  Pathnames are supplied by the sending
	  program, and directories are made if necessary (and
	  possible).  Normally,	the "rz" command is automatically
	  issued by the	calling	ZMODEM program,	but defective ZMODEM
	  implementations may require starting _r_z manually.

	  RRRRbbbb receives file(s) with YMODEM, accepting either standard
	  128 byte sectors or 1024 byte	sectors	(YAM sb	----kkkk option).
	  The user should determine when the 1024 byte block length
	  actually improves throughput.

	  If True YMODEM (Omen Technology trademark) file information
	  (file	length,	etc.) is received, the file length controls
	  the number of	bytes written to the output dataset, and the
	  modify time and file mode (iff non zero) are set
	  accordingly.

	  If True YMODEM file information is not received, slashes in
	  the pathname are changed to underscore, and any trailing
	  period in the	pathname is eliminated.	 This conversion is
	  useful for files received from CP/M and other	historical
	  systems.

	  RRRRcccc receives a	single _f_i_l_e with XMODEM-CRC or XMODEM-1k-CRC
	  protocol.  The user should determine when the	1024 byte
	  block	length actually	improves throughput without causing
	  problems.  The user must supply the file name	to both
	  sending and receiving	programs.  Up to 1023 garbage
	  characters may be added to the received file.

	  RRRRxxxx receives a	single _f_i_l_e with XMODEM	or XMODEM-1k protocol.
	  The user should determine when the 1024 byte block length
	  actually improves throughput without causing problems.  The

	  received file.

	  GGGGzzzz is	a shell	script which calls _s_z to command Pro-YAM or
	  ZCOMM	to transmit the	specified files.  Pathnames used with
	  _g_z must be escaped if	they have special significance to the
	  Unix shell.
	  EXAMPLE: gz "-a C:*.c	D:*.h"

	  If invoked with a leading ``v'', _r_z will report progress to
	  /tmp/rzlog.
	  EXAMPLE: ln rz vrz; rz=vrz; export rz

	  If the SHELL environment variable includes _r_s_h or _r_k_s_h
	  (restricted shell), _r_z will not accept absolute pathnames or
	  references to	a parent directory, will not modify an
	  existing file, and removes any files received	in error.

	  We have received numerous reports of terminal	servers
	  interfering with protocol file transfers.  Sometimes special
	  terminal server commands correct the problem.	 In other
	  cases, the terminal server software is defective and must be
	  corrected.

	  ZMODEM's support of XOFF/XON flow control allows proper
	  operation in many environments that do not support XMODEM
	  uploads.  Unfortunately, not all Unix	versions support input
	  flow control.	 The TTY input buffering on some systems may
	  not adequately buffer	long blocks or streaming input at high
	  speed.  You should suspect this problem when you can't send
	  data to the Unix system at high speeds using ZMODEM,
	  YMODEM-1k or XMODEM-1k, but YMODEM with 128 byte blocks
	  works	properly.

	  The DSZ or Pro-YAM zzzzmmmmooooddddeeeemmmm llll numeric parameter	may be set to
	  a value between 64 and 1024 to limit the burst length
	  ("zmodem pl128").  Although this compromises ZMODEM's
	  throughput, ZMODEM's superior	reliability remains intact.

	  If a program that does not properly implement	the specified
	  file transfer	protocol causes	_r_z to "hang" the port after a
	  failed transfer, either wait for _r_z to time out or keyboard
	  a dozen Ctrl-X characters.  Every reported instance of this
	  problem has been corrected by	using ZCOMM, Pro-YAM, DSZ, or
	  other	program	with a correct implementation of the specified
	  protocol.

	  Many programs	claiming to support YMODEM only	support	XMODEM
	  with 1k blocks, and they often don't get that	quite right.

	  In the case of a few poorly designed microcomputers, sending
	  serial data to a tty port at sustained high speeds has been

	  known	to cause lockups, system halts,	kernel panics, and
	  occasional antisocial	behaviour.  This problem is not	unique
	  to _r_z; newer versions	of Kermit, CRT terminals with screen
	  transmission,	and line noise have the	same effect.  When
	  experimenting	with high speed	input to a system, consider
	  rebooting the	system if the file transfers are not
	  successful, especially if the	personality of the system
	  appears altered.

	  The Unix "ulimit" parameter must be set high enough to
	  permit large file transfers to Unix.

	  Telebit modems must not be set to "spoof" UUCP, XMODEM,
	  YMODEM, or KERMIT.  Setting one of these spoofing modes
	  interferes with other	protoocls.  Telebit's YMODEM spoofing
	  interferes with YMODEM transfers.

	  Escaping control characters (sz -E) may help if the transfer
	  gets stuck in	the same place on every	attempt.
	  Professional-YAM and ZCOMM allow selection of	which control
	  characters need to be	escaped.

	  In extreme cases 7-bit transmission may be required (see
