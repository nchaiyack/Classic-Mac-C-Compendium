.SH NAME
telewords, telenum \- convert telephone numbers into words and vice versa
.SH SYNOPSIS
telewords [-\fId\fPc...] ... number
.br
telenum [-\fId\fPc...] ...  string ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fITelewords\fP takes a telephone number as the single input argument
and outputs, one per line, all of the equivalent "words",
in the hope that one of them will be a real word, or at least
pronounceable.  The digits 0 and 1,  which don't have corresponding letters,
are printed as themselves.  Command line options allow you to change
the string of characters into which any digit is mapped.
This is helpful with some automatic teller machine keypads that
put q and z on the 1 key.   (Why doesn't the phone company do that?)
The given phone number can have a arbitrary number of digits, and non-digits
are ignored: '(301) 555-1212' is the same as '3015551212' (provided the
space is properly quoted to the shell).
.PP
\fITelenum\fP performs the reverse transform.  Given a string of alphabetic
characters (either case) it will print the equivalent phone number.
The same remapping, using the same syntax as \fItelewords\fP can be used.
.SH OPTIONS  
The -\fId\fP option allows you to change the mapping for any digit. 
The \fId\fP represents any digit.  This digit is
followed by a string of characters which will be used as the characters
into which that digit maps.  Thus, to cause 1 to map to 'q' and 'z'
use the command 
.sp
telewords -1qz 555-1212
.sp
As many -\fId\fP options can be given as desired, allowing the complete map
to be redefined.  If a -\fId\fP option is given without a following string
then mapping for that digit will be turned off, and the input digit will
print as itself.  Thus, the default behaviour 
is as if the command had been given with options -0 and -1.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
None.
.SH BUGS
There is no easy way in the current implementation to allow a digit
to map to a string instead of just a character.  This would allow, for
example, 0 to map to "oper".
(I once knew a person whose number spelled INoperTUNE!)
