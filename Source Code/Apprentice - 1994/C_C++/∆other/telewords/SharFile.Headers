Telewords will mapa telephone number into all the corresponding "words", using thestandard mapping found on American phones (2=ABC, 3=DEF, etc.).  Telenumwill do the opposite mapping, taking a string of letters and printingwhat the corresponding phone number would be.  Both programs also supportsalternate mappings.  See the man pages.Enjoy!Jim Williams
