Dizzy is a freeware digital circuit designand simulation program.Actually the program says that it is called xdizzy, because I reallywrote it for X windows and Motif. I did all the initial developmentwork on a Mac and ported the result to X. This means that I didn'treally concentrate on writing a good Macintosh application.Features:o  Basic gates, flip-flops, binary I/O, hex outputo  Custom sub-circuits (as in DigSim)o  Circuits stored in readable text file format.o  Easy to port to almost any graphical environmento  Very easy to extend and modify.What's not so nice:o  No printing.o  Only one window.o  European symbols instead of standard American.o  No pull-down menus.o  No copy & paste.o  No multiple selections.As I said above, the program is quite easy to modify, so there'sno reason why all of the above could not be added.Juri MunkkiHelsinki University of Technologyjmunkki@hut.fi
