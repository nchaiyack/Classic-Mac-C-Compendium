graph3Dchris@carnival.lbl.gov (Chris Moll)Herein find the C source for a 3D graphing program I wrotesome time ago.	The program demostrates how to do non-perspective 3Dplotting and mathematical expression parsing.  All math isfloating point, though some of the code for fixed point mathremains.  It is not particularly well commented, since I neverwrote it for other eyes; in most cases I was interested soleyin speed, not readability.  Feel free to send me any questions,though I don't guaruntee useful answers.	Since this program was mostly an experiment, it is guiltyof some unfortunate behavior, such as writing directly to thescreen buffer; I don't nescessarily encourage anyone to emulatemy examples in this regard.	I've retained the copyright; feel free to steal ideas atwhim.  If you extract significant sections of code unchanged,copy the copyright message at the top of each file.	This version incorporates the ability to read the filesgenerated by Dave Platt's MandelZot program and plot them aslandscapes.	This version compiles in ThinkC5.03, the latest version inmy possesion.
