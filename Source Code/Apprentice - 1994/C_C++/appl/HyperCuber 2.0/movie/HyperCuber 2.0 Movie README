HyperCuber 2.0 Movie

This movie was created using HyperCuber 2.0, a freeware program by Greg 
Ferrar, and PICTs to Movie, a freeware program by David Rees.  It shows
a four-dimensional rotation of a four-dimensional cube (hypercube)
projected onto three-dimensional space.  Antialiasing was used to
improve image quality.

Two-Image Stereo was turned on to enhance the 3D effect.  This is a 
"cross-eyed" stereo movie; if you look at the left picture with your 
right eye and the right picture with your left eye, the object will 
appear to be three-dimensional.  To do this, you will need to cross your 
eyes.  You should at first see four images-- focus until you see only 
three.  It may be useful to hold a finger in front of your face, focus on 
it, and move it closer and farther from your face until you see three 
images behind it.  When you can see three images, focus on the middle 
one.  When it is in focus for both eyes, the object will look 
three-dimensional.

This movie was made from individually saved frames from HyperCuber.  So 
though you too can make movies with HyperCuber and PICTs to Movie, don't 
expect it to be easy; HyperCuber does not support QuickTime movie 
generation; it just lets you save still frames.  Perhaps in a later
version....

HyperCuber 2.0 is available now from major Macintosh ftp sites.  For
