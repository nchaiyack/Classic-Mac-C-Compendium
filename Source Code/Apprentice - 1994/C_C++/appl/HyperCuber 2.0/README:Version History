HyperCuber 2.0 by Greg FerrarHyperCuber is a program which displays and rotates higher-dimensionalobjects (like four-dimensional "hypercubes").  It requires a 68020processor or better, a math coprocessor, and System 7 or better.Complete documentation for the program is contained in the HyperCuberManual file, which is a stand-alone document created with DocMaker.Comments, suggestions, and error reports to Greg Ferrar by email at  gregt@math.ohio-state.eduor by snail mail at  Greg Ferrar  2300 N High Street  Columbus OH  43202-2902  Enjoy!================================ To Do List ==============================Here are some plans for the future.  I don't promise that any of them willever get done, but if you think of something that should be on here thatisn't, or see something here that should not be, let me know!¥ Solid polygon modelling (as opposed to wire frame).  If I do this, I will  probably try to make it work arbitrary dimensions (i.e. hidden solid  removal in 4-space), so this isn't an easy one.¥ Eliminate floating point math¥ Command to change window to standard screen sizes (useful for making  startup screens)¥ "predefined" rotations; user would set parameters of rotation (bounds,  increment) and HyperCuber would rotating the object continuously.¥ Other options for creating object (perhaps create new object based on  mathematical functions).================================ Version History ==============================Version 2.0 (released May 3, 1994)-----------¥ Changed manual format from Word to DocMaker.¥ Added user-defined objects (using object file).¥ Added support for objects of arbitrary dimension.  This was the biggie, and  much of the code had to be rewritten.  A lot of the other changes were  a direct result of this one.¥ Added support for viewing multiple objects simultaneously.¥ Totally changed and improved Keyboard Controls... window ¥ Totally changed and improved Mouse Controls... window ¥ Added "Create N-Cube" command¥ Split controls into multiple windows, one dimension per window¥ Changed the way the Perspective works¥ Lost the ability to display axes (sigh...I'll try to add it back later).¥ Improved Copy command so it copies object-oriented pictures if antialiasing  is turned off, and copies bitmap pictures if antialiasing is turned on.  ¥ Lots of other minor changesVersion 1.2 (limited release) -----------¥ Removed support for non-Color QuickDraw machines (it never worked very well  anyway...).  Removed support for 68000 machines, since they don't have Color  QuickDraw.¥ Added fast antialiasing of line segments.¥ Added an offscreen bitmap for fast window updating¥ Slightly changed default left eye color so it won't cancel itself out.¥ Added "click and drag"-style control of the viewpoint (like MacMolecule).  Added Mouse Controls... menu item for customizing this.¥ Made scroll bars "live," so the images changes dynamically while the bars  are dragged.  Along the same lines, improved the "dynamicness" of the  number to the left of each scroll bar.  Basically, whatever you do, the  number, the scroll bar, and the image will agree at all times.¥ Made scroll bars wrap around, so that an attempt to go beyond the range of  the scroll bar will wind up at the other end.  Shortened range of scroll  bars to eliminate redundant angles (necessary before in order to allow long  rotations; wraparound bars allow infinitely long rotations, if desired).¥ Added Keyboard Controls... menu item for customizing keyboard rotation  control.¥ Gamma-corrected the antialiasing table-- yields MUCH better looking lines,  with no affect on speed. ¥ Added menu item to make windows full-screen¥ Added menu item to hide or show the menubar.Version 1.1.2 (never released)-------------¥ Added support for non-Color QuickDraw machines.¥ Added a different version for machines without a 68000 or FPU.¥ Added a Default button to the Colors window, to reset colors to their  default values.¥ Merged this HyperCuber Version History file and the README file.¥ Limited values of delta and rho to a smaller interval, to prevent  arithmetic overflow when drawing.  Version 1.1.1 (released August 21, 1993)-------------¥ Added checking for Color QuickDraw, and added code to exit gracefully  if Color QuickDraw is not present.  I'm not sure why it requires Color  QuickDraw (or if it does) but the folks at UMich have a 68030-accelerated  Mac SE which crashes.  This change shouldn't affect many people, since  there are few non-Color QuickDraw machines which have 68020s or better.Version 1.1 (released August 19, 1993)-----------¥ Added keyboard control of all the scroll bars.¥ Colored the hypercube based on x coordinated, to improve perception of what's  going on.¥ Moved the options (check boxes and radio buttons) to the Options menu.¥ Moved the scroll bars to a separate Controls window, which can be hidden.  Also rearranged scroll bars to make them as compact as possible.  This makes  it much easier to use HyperCuber on small-screen Macs.¥ Changed name of window from "HyperCuber Window" to "HyperCube".¥ Massively rehauled the internal class structure.  This makes no difference  at present, but the program is now more easily extendable to multiple  windows, multiple views, and multiple documents (objects).¥ Implemented Save As PICT File option.Version 1.0.1 (released August 14, 1993)-------------¥ Introduced code to determine processor type, existence of FPU, existence  of System 7.0 or later, etc., and to abort if HyperCuber could not run in the  environment under which it had been launched.¥ Improved window placement routines so windows can not be placed off-screen,  and so they will would automatically fill the screen if no preference file  exists or if the preferred location of the window is off-screen.¥ Added version number to About... window.¥ Added two cases for About... window: when there is plenty of memory, the  nifty (but memory-intensive) bitmap picture is drawn.  When memory is limited,  the slightly-less-nifty object-PICT is drawn instead.  This lowered memory  requirement from 450K to 300K (anything below 450K loses the bitmap About...  picture).¥ Fixed (hopefully) a bug which could cause crashes on some machines when  changing preferences.  I was not able to reproduce this bug, but I revamped  some questionable sections of the preferences code to make them safer.Version 1.0 (released August 11, 1993)-----------First released version
