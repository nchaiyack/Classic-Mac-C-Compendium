HyperCuber 2.0 Source Code by Greg FerrarThis directory contains the source code to HyperCuber 2.0, a freeware program which can display and rotate objects of arbitrary dimension.  HyperCuber 2.0 is available separately from major Mac ftp sites, and includes complete documentation.HyperCuber 2.0 was written using Symantec C++ 6.0, which is a really nice programming environment (7.0 is in the mail...).  You should be able to compile and run it immediately.I have not made any special attempt to prepare this code for distribution, so it appears here exactly as I wrote it.  I tried to write clear and well-documented code, but I don't guarantee anything.  I especially don't guarantee that it all works properly, though I know of no blantant bugs.If you have any questions about my code, feel free to send me email at gregt@math.ohio-state.edu.  I will do my best to help you understand what I have written.  -Greg Ferrar (gregt@math.ohio-state.edu)
