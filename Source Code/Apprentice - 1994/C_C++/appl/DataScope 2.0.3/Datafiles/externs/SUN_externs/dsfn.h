/**  Declarations for externally callable routines for the DataScope server*  on SUN UNIX machines.**  Add your external function to each of the lists.*  The internal routine, when compiled, will automatically register the*  routine name and which function to call.*  *  The routine name does not need to match the function name string.*  *  There is one important qualification:  fortran subroutine references*  called from "C" must have an underscore (_) appended to the*  reference in the "C" code.  In the example shown below, a FORTRAN*  subroutine norm() is referenced as norm_(); in the actual FORTRAN*  source code, this underscore is NOT included.**  Remember that on SUN4 systems, you cannot run external subroutines*  unless your IP number is hardcoded into the system table as a remote*  host; this is because DataScope uses the rexecd socket, where this*  restriction applies.*/int 	norm_(),					/* FORTRAN declaration */	exhifilter(),				/* C declaration */	scos(),	smooth(),					/* add your entry here */	puts();						/* dummy entry, anchors list */struct flist {	char *namestring;	int (*fncall)();};struct flist dsc[] = {	"hifilter",exhifilter,	"sincos",scos,	"smooth",smooth,			/* add your entry here */	"",puts	};struct flist dsf[] = {			/* FORTRAN calls list */	"norm",norm_,	"",puts	};
