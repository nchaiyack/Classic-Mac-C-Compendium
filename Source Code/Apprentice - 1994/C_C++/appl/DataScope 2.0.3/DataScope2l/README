This is the source code distribution for NCSA DataScope. It is providedas is, and this documentation is it. Sorry, but we are just not fundedto support the source.To build the thing, just run BigMake, and execute the output just as ifyou ran make. When the BigMake is done, some more commands will be displayed ( the link and rez). You must also select and execute these commands. When you are done you will have an executable. You need theMacTCP include files to compile this guy. Contact Apple for information.I used MPW 3.2 to compile this guy.Have fun.Thomas Redmanredman@ncsa.uiuc.edu
