HDF Vset release 2.1 MAY 1991

In this version:

(A) Vinsert now checks for and prevent duplicate links.

(B) New utilities:

	 vmake - allows you to create a vdata from ascii data, or to
	 	      create a null vgroup, or create links in a HDF file.

	 vshow - lists vset info in a file. Replaces vdir.

(C) You may redefine fields that were originally defined.

(D) New LONG integer storage

	If the integer values in your dataset are greater than 65535 you 
	should store them as longs. Your integer array must be declared
	long, and the field associated with those long values should be
	declared to be of type LOCAL_LONGTYPE:

	long mylongdata[10];
   VDATA * vs;

	VSfdefine(vs,"BIGFLD",LOCAL_INTTYPE,1);
	VSwrite(vs,mylongdata,10,FULL_INTERLACEs);
	etc

(E) New class fields

	 A secondary field, the class field, now exists for each vdata
    or each vgroup.  This field behaves like the file extension in
    file names, and should be used to classified related elements.
	 Generally, an application should specify what class name to use.

	 Class fields are accessed by the new routines VSgetclass, Vgetclass,
	 VSsetclass, VSsetclass.

(F) Multiple files	

	 Several files may be opened for vset access simultaneously.
	 No new calls are needed.
	 The parameter VFILEMAX (in vg.h) specifies the max number of files 
	 that may be accessed simultaneously.

(G) Memory allocation for vdata and vgroups are now done dynamically,
	 The parameters VSDIRMAX and VGDIRMAX are now omitted from vg.h.

(H) Creation of empty vdatas and vgroups
	 Empty vgroups may be created, but not vdatas.

(I) HIGH-LEVEL routines for creating simple vgroups and vdatas.
    3 routines, VHmakegroup, VHstoredata and VHstoredatam are one line
	 calls to create and store data.
	 Available in Fortran as VHFMKGP, VHFSD and VHFSDM.
