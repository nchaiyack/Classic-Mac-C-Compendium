This is HDF Vset release 2.1.

(1) For creating the Vset library, look in the Makefile, and modify according 
    to instructions in it.

(2) Vmake, vshow and vcompat are nice utilities to have. Each can be created
    by something like
     "cc -D<machine> prog.c -o prog libdf.a libvg.a -I<d*.h include files dir>"

(3) Files "do" and "fdo" are sample compile commands for creating vset programs.
