20APR93I've written this INIT to allow MacGS to peacefully co-exist with such extensionsas BeHierachic and MenuChoice, which unfortunately do not restore an application'sresource file context after they execute.  Because MacGS' Graphics User Interfaceis implemented as a device driver, and therefore does *not* ever explicitly invokeMenuSelect (), I've written this INIT to patch BeHierarchic's and MenuChoice'sMenuSelect () patches.  However, as with all such extensions *caveat emptor*!     ...Martin Fong				mwfong@nisc.sri.com
