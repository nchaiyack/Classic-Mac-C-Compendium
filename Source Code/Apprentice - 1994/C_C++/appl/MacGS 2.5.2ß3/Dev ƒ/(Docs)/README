******** An overview of Ghostscript ********
********

Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:

	- An interpreter for the PostScript (TM) language, and

	- A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that
implement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive
operations in the PostScript language.

The Ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely
in C, with some assembly-language accelerators for MS-DOS platforms.
Currently, Ghostscript is known to run on the following platform
families:

	- IBM PC and compatibles with EGA, VGA, SuperVGA, or compatible
	  graphics under MS-DOS 3.1, 3.3, or 5.0, with or without
	  Microsoft Windows 3.0 or 3.1;

	- A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 11,
	  release 3, 4, and 5, including Sun-3, Sun-4, Sun-386i,
	  Sun SPARCStation 1 and 2; generic 80386 machines running 386/ix,
	  ISC Unix, and SCO Unix; H-P 9000/300 and 9000/800;
	  DECStation 2100 and 3100; VAX running Ultrix; Sequent Symmetry;
	  Convex C1 and C2; Tektronix 4300; SGI Iris Indigo;

	- Sun workstations (Sun-3, SPARC, Sun-386i) running SunView;

	- VAX, VMS with X11R3/4/5, gcc and DEC C compiler (DEC C compiler
	  version 3.1 or later is required).

It is very likely that Ghostscript will run under other versions of
MS-DOS, and other versions of Unix that support X11, but it has not
been tested in these environments.  Ghostscript does NOT run well on
PC-compatibles with Hercules display cards: text and graphics output
interfere with each other.

Ghostscript has also been ported to the Apple Macintosh and to the
Acorn Archimedes.  For information on the Macintosh port, contact
Martin Fong (fong@erg.sri.com).  For information on the Archimedes
port, contact David Elworthy (David.Elworthy@cl.cam.ac.uk).

There are two freely available X Windows screen previewers based on
Ghostscript: Ghostview and GSPreview.  For information on Ghostview,
contact Tim Theisen (ghostview@cs.wisc.edu).  For information on
GSPreview, contact Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk).

A set of patches and additions for Kanji capability for Ghostscript
version 2.4.1 is available for anonymous FTP from
ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:GNU/gs241j11.tar.Z.  For more information, contact
Mr. Norio Katayama (katayama@nacsis.ac.jp).

********
******** Documentation overview ********
********

All the file names mentioned in the documentation, except for README,
are in lower case, which is the usual convention for Unix systems.
On MS-DOS systems, all file names are actually upper-case.

When you receive Ghostscript, you should start by reading:

> README - this file.

> readme.doc - information about problems and major changes new
features in the current release.

If you have used a previous release of Ghostscript, you probably
should also read any more recent sections of:

> NEWS - a complete, detailed history of changes in Ghostscript
releases.

Especially for new users
------------------------

If you are a new user of Ghostscript, you should read:

> use.doc - information about to use Ghostscript.

If you are going to compile Ghostscript, rather than just use an
executable you got from somewhere, you should read:

> make.doc - how to install, compile and link Ghostscript.

If you run into any questions, or if you are going to be using
Ghostscript extensively, you should at least skim, and probably
eventually read:

> fonts.doc - information about the fonts distributed with
Ghostscript, including how to add or replace fonts.

> language.doc - A description of the Ghostscript language, and its
differences from the documented PostScript language.

> psfiles.doc - information about the .ps files distributed with
Ghostscript (other than fonts).

Especially for developers
-------------------------

If you are going to be writing a new driver for Ghostscript, you
should read:

> drivers.doc - the interface between Ghostscript and device drivers.

Odds and ends
-------------

> hershey.doc - information about the Hershey fonts, which are the
basis of some of the Ghostscript fonts.

> humor.doc - a humorous comment on Ghostscript contributed by a net.person.

> lib.doc - information about the Ghostscript library.

> man.doc - a possible Un*x 'man' page for Ghostscript.

******** Trouble reporting ********
********

Aladdin Enterprises doesn't have the resources to respond to questions
from general users of Ghostscript.  If you have problems with
Ghostscript, and you have access to Usenet news, we suggest you post
your question to gnu.ghostscript.bug.  There are hundreds of
Ghostscript user sites all over the world, and often another user will
be able to help you.  If you are having trouble with a specific device
driver, look in the file devs.mak and see if it is a user-maintained
driver.  If so, you may contact the person listed there directly;
please do not contact Aladdin Enterprises regarding user-maintained
drivers.

Aladdin Enterprises does want Ghostscript to be of high quality, so if
you have been running Ghostscript and encounter a problem, we will be
glad to investigate it if you meet all the following criteria:

	- You are using the most recent version of Ghostscript.

	- You obtained Ghostscript directly from Aladdin Enterprises,
	or from a GNU distribution site on the Internet.

	- You have installed Ghostscript successfully, and used it
	successfully on other input data.

	- Your problem is reproducible, and you can send us the input
	data that evokes it (by e-mail, anonymous FTP, or PC diskette).

	- Your bug report tells us what hardware, operating system,
	window system, and C compiler you are using.

Bug reports that include suggested fixes are especially welcome.

As time permits, Aladdin Enterprises will also respond to e-mail from
the following classes of users:

	- Beta testers who have actually given us at least one report on
	some beta version supplied to them.

	- People developing drivers that are for, or applications that
	are based on, Ghostscript and that will be made freely available.

	- People who express serious interest in commercial licensing
	of Ghostscript.

	- Commercial licensees.

Given the choice between the Internet and the UUCP address, remember
that the Internet is not to be used for general commercial traffic:
if you aren't sure whether you or your organization can use the
Internet, use UUCP.

Aladdin Enterprises owns or has access to the following hardware and
software:

	80486 PC, MS-DOS 5.0, Microsoft Windows 3.0;
	  Borland C++ 3.1 (and several older versions);
	  color SuperVGA display; Epson-compatible printer
	  (the printer also is compatible with the IBM Proprinter);
	  various H-P printers; Canon BubbleJet.

	SPARCstation, SunOS 4.1, cc and gcc, X11R5 and SunView;
	  both monochrome and color displays.

	DECstation, Ultrix.

If your problem turns out to be specific to some other hardware or
software configuration, it may take longer to track down, since we
will have to rely on other users to help.

If you wish to contact Aladdin Enterprises directly, you may reach us
at:

machine.  In this case, please leave a message with your name and
phone number and the best time for us to return the call.

******** Things you can do to help ********
********

There are some projects that users could do that are somewhat
decoupled from the main body of the code, and that would help improve
Ghostscript:

	- Ghostscript needs some good, free, Type 1 (outline) fonts.
Karl Berry is working on this, but it might go faster if he got some
knowledgeable assistance.  Contact karl@cs.umb.edu if you want to
help with this.

	- Several people have asked for a program that will take
PostScript code and reconstruct some reasonable ASCII form of the
input, if this is possible.  Ghostscript's gs_2asc.ps utility does a
fair job of extracting the strings and their placement on the page,
but that's only the easy half of the job: a second pass is needed to
figure out, at a minimum, where paragraph breaks are (based on Y
positioning), and where spaces go (based on X positioning).  Contact
ghost@aladdin.com if you want to help by doing this.

	- Adobe has donated the specification of the Display
PostScript C API to the X distribution.  Implementing this API for
Ghostscript might make Ghostscript a lot more useful, since it would
then be "plug compatible" with Display PostScript in an important
way.  This might not be a very big project.  Contact
ghost@aladdin.com if you would like to help with this.

	- On gray-scale displays, it might be worthwhile implementing
anti-aliased fonts.  To do this, one would modify the renderer so
that it cached a high-resolution bitmap, and then did the
anti-aliasing as it copied the bitmap to the device.  This would
allow simulating fractional-pixel positioning, which is one of the
great benefits of anti-aliased fonts.  Contact ghost@aladdin.com if
this is of interest to you.
