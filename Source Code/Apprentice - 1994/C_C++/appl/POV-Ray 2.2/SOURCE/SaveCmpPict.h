/*==============================================================================Project:	POV-RayVersion:	2.2File Name:	SaveCmpPict.hDescription:	Routines for saving a PICT file in QuickTime compressed format.		This source code was written with a lot of help from some examples	off of Apple's QuickTime 1.0 Developer CD.	Note that this source requires the as-yet non-standard header files	and glue files for QuickTime and the Standard Compression dialog.	These files will need to accompany this source until Apple rolls them	into MPW/Think.  The additional files needed are listed below:	Components.h			- MPW/Think - QuickTime Component header	ImageCompression.h		- MPW/Think - QuickTime Image Compression header	StdCompression.h		- MPW/Think - Std Compression dialog header	StdCompression.rsrc		- MPW/Think - Std Compression dialog resource	StdCompressionGlue.o	- MPW - Std Compression dialog glue routines	StdCompressionGlue.¹	- Think - Std Compression dialog glue routinesRelated Files:	SaveCmpPict.h: header file for Save Compressed Pict routines	SaveCmpPict.c: main file for Save Compressed Pict routines------------------------------------------------------------------------------Author:	Eduard [esp] Schwan------------------------------------------------------------------------------	from Persistence of Vision Raytracer	Copyright 1993 Persistence of Vision Team------------------------------------------------------------------------------	NOTICE: This source code file is provided so that users may experiment	with enhancements to POV-Ray and to port the software to platforms other 	than those supported by the POV-Ray Team.
