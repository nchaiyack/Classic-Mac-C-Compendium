I've spent quite some time supporting this program now.
If you use it much, and feel like it, you can send me
some money, or software you've written for the amiga, 
I won't refuse it.

I don't DEMAND this, mind you. If you don't feel like
it, you are perfectly legitimate in using tracker and not
sending me anything.

Also, you won't get anything better if you do send money.
Let's just say, I'm not quite sure I will be able to spend
more time working on tracker, and this might act as incentive
for me to add more features. Then again, I may not have any time
less for working on tracker.

This said, my postal address is:
Marc Espie
60 rue du quatre septembre
87100 Limoges
France

I can deal with french francs, or US checks. Anything else you'll
have to try.

	Marc Espie
