     This is Think C 6.01 port of David Bell's Calc 1.24.7 program.       Calc is arbitrary precision arithmetic system that uses a C-like     language.  Calc is useful as a calculator, an algorithm prototyped and     as a mathematical research tool.     The calc language is a C-like language.  The language includes commands     such as variable declarations, expressions, tests, labels, loops, file     operations, function calls.  These commands are very similar to their     counterparts in C.     A rich set of builtin functions is provided.  Fundamental builtin data types      include integers, real numbers, rational numbers, complex numbers and strings.     By use of an object, one may define an arbitrarily complex data types.     One may define how such objects behave a wide range of operations such     as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, negation, squaring,     modulus, rounding, exponentiation, equality, comparison, printing and so     on.             Copyright (c) 1992 David I.
