It was never widely released.		This source is not up-to-date, except for this comment.		I plan to return to work on anagram engines and user interfaces someday, but		it's not going to be soon.  I've been thinking hard about user interfaces		for this app since 1984 (the original app was done in '82), and haven't come		up with anything good.  My hope is that various developers will experiment,		steal each other's best ideas, and in general have a real good time.  I've		already seen some people take Ars Magna's bad user interface and produce a		worse one; get creative here, folks, will ya?		A few disconnected ideas, more or less off the top of my head:			* I want to be able to say "Show me everything with word ____"			* Then, of course, the remaining mainstream anagrams omit that word			*	Similarly, I want to be able to say "Show me everything with words ____				and ____".			* I want to be able to say "Don't ever show me this word during this session"			* I want to be able to say "Don't ever show me this word, ever"			* This version tries to do one-word anagrams, then two-word, etc.  It				tends to lock up at the each length; there's some obvious pruning				that can be done here.			*	Reviewing the output can take hours, so:				(1) the user should be able to do nearly everything with the keyboard				(2) they should be able to save their complete search state			* The app should handle various dictionary formats, and set one or more				default dictionaries as a preference.			* I've never been able to find foreign-language dictionaries; anyone				know if there are public-domain ones around?			*	Word order and search order are very important to producing good				anagrams early in the search.  What are the possible orderings?				Which help in which ways?  How should the user control them?			* The list of eligible words should be displayed somewhere.  The user				should be able to save it, specify hot words to try first, etc.			*	There should be a way to show incomplete anagrams, with the user				specifying the maximum number of unused letters to show (zero would				make the app behave as it does now).  They should be able to rearrange				unused letters under keyboard or mouse control.			*	Once you've found an anagram which looks interesting, the app should				let you rearrange them under keyboard or mouse control, or quickly				display all orderings of the words.  Of course, a quick command should				save an anagram to the list of cool anagrams.			*	When listing anagrams, a change in a given column should be highlighted				to wake up a bored user.  This version does this crudely with capitals				when a word first appears in a column, as in this example:						CLIMATE HO MR NO						climate ho mr ON						climate MR NO OH						climate mr OH ON			*	I hate retyping anagrams for posting or publication, so the app should:				(1) Allow easy word-shuffling and punctuation and capitalization						changes in the saved list of cool anagrams.				(2) Quickly check a text file or the clipboard's contents to make						sure they're right.			*	You should be able to export the list of cool anagrams to the				clipboard or a text file.			* The current bit-banging scheme makes sure that an anagram contains				exactly the right number of letters, by adding them up and checking				that the count is exactly right.  This could be generalized to make				sure the count is in a certain range for an attribute OTHER than a				letter.  This is useful for:				(a) I'm using several dictionaries, but only one is new, so show me						only anagrams with one or more words from that dictionary.				(b)	I want to see no more than 2 one-letter words.				(c)	I want to see at least one word that I've marked as interesting.			*	Or, if you want to use the counter scheme for "no more than one of"				or "at least one of", you could use AND and OR instead of addition.			*	I should be able to quickly count all the anagrams which will result				from a partial anagram I've found, to help me decide when to explore.			*	I've tried a NeXT-style browser interface and, at least the way I did				it, it was lousy.  Not interactive enough.			*	You might be able to prune or order anagrams on the basis of available				or constructed information on word-pair frequencies in natural languages.				This idea strikes me as promising, but I haven't done anything with it.			*	Extra credit: Parse the anagrams as natural language to find good ones.			Don't expect that doing all of the above will give you a good app.  This is			just a laundry list, not an overall vision of a good UI.  I've talked to			good anagrammers, and they work on paper and in their heads -- devising an			interface which is easier for them, not just for a beginner, will be hard.		If you develop an app, prototype or not, commercial or not, I'd be interested		in seeing it and commenting on the UI.  If you feel like sharing the source,		I'd be interested in that, too.		Keep in touch,				Mr. Machine Tool				February, 1993		Email:	Mike_Morton@Proponent.com		Paper:	Mike Morton, POB 11299, Honolulu, HI  96828*/#include "stdio.h"#include "stdlib.h"#include "string.h"#include "console.h"#include "Types.h"#include "Files.h"/* Easily changeable constants: */#define STRMAX			100								/* size of some strings */#define MAXFILES		10								/* maximum number of dictionaries */#define MAXMASKS		5									/* number of "masks" for bitbanging */																			/* note that doanagram() depends on MAXMASKS */#define DFTFILE			"anagram dict"		/* default dictionary name */#define	WPTRDELTA		512								/* # of word ptrs to add */#define TEXBSIZE		2048							/* size of a block of text */#define DOTFREQ			25								/* anagrams per dot, when filing/counting */#define DOTSPERLINE	40								/* dots per line for filing/counting */#define PAGESIZE		22								/* lines between prompts */#define WORDCHUNK		5000							/* size of chunks for words *//* Not-so-easily-changeable things: */#define mask		long									/* masks are stored in longwords */#define maskwidth	8*sizeof(mask)			/* and their size is important *//* Global stuff -- phrase information: */char phrase [STRMAX];									/* the phrase to be anagrammed */char origphrase [STRMAX];							/* unmunged copy of phrase */short freqs [26];											/* frequency table for phrase */short letmask [26], letbit [26];			/* mask, bit positions for each letter */short letwidth[26];										/* width in mask of each letter */short usedmasks;											/* count of used masks */short minWords, maxWords;mask oflodesc [MAXMASKS];							/* descriptor used to detect overflow */mask phrasedesc [MAXMASKS];						/* descriptor for main phrase */mask startdesc [MAXMASKS];						/* starting descriptor for search *//* Global stuff -- Dictionary information */short numdicts = 0;										/* number of dictionaries */FILE *dicts [MAXFILES];								/* dictionary files */short numwords;												/* number of eligible words */short maxwords = 0;										/* number of words which fit in *wordlist */char **wordlist = NULL;								/* words[0..maxwords-1],																							with 0..numwords-1 used */mask *worddescs;											/* descriptors [0..numwords-1] */struct wchunk {	struct wchunk *next;	char text [WORDCHUNK];};char *nextwcp = NULL;									/* pointer to next char to fill */short nextwleft = 0;									/* chars left in this block */struct wchunk *curchunk = NULL;				/* pointer to current chunk */struct wchunk *chunkhead = NULL;			/* pointer to first chunk *//* Global stuff -- For printing anagrams */char *anawords [20];									/* stacked words */char **anaptr;												/* pointer to first unused slot */FILE *anafile;												/* stdin for screen, output file, or NULL */short silent;													/* 1 iff not printing to screen */unsigned long anacount;								/* number of anagrams found */unsigned long startt, endt, tottime;	/* timing information */short paging;													/* pause after each screenful?
