¥ I don't like the interface / I'd like batch processingIf you don't want to use the menus to change mode and process, use the Drag & Drop mode:1: Quit MacGzip (if it is open)2: If the files you want to compress/uncompress are in the same folder, select them all from the Finder and Drag & Drop them on MacGzip icon; if the files are in different folders; you will have to put the parent folder in 'list by name' mode before the selection.3: If you want    a) Compress them: Hold option key until window appears    b) Uncompress them in ASCII mode: Hold 'a' key until window appears    c) Uncompress them in binary mode: Hold 'b' key until window appears    d) Uncompress them in default (last selected in gzip menu) mode: nothing¥ How can I abort a compress/uncompress process?Cmd-period (as in almost every mac application) ÀDid you read the 'Readme' file?¥ What should I put in the 'gzip suffix' preference?For all operating systems, ".gz", ".z", ".Z", ".taz", ".tgz", "-gz", "-z" and "_z" are accepted suffixes, in addition to the value of the --suffix option. (".tgz" is a useful convention for tar.z)The --suffix option is the value you enter in 'gzip suffix' preference; so you should let it empty if you are using the standard gzip 1.2.4.If your UNIX host has an older gzip (which creates compressed files with .z) you should put '.z' in this field of macgzip preferences; but the best option would be to update your UNIX gzip to the last version (currently -03/19/94- is 1.2.4).¥ What is the meaning of 'ASCII' in 'gzip' menu?     -a --ascii          Ascii text mode: convert end-of-lines using local  con-          ventions.  This  option  is supported only on some non-          Unix systems.let's have the ASCII file 'pc.txt' on an DOS machinewe can make:  gzip -c pc.txt > pc.gz  gzip -ca pc.txt > pca.gzthen, we put this files in our mac and:  gzip 'uncompress' 'binary' of pc.gz gives us a file with EOL=<CR><LF> (bad)  gzip 'uncompress' 'binary' of pca.gz gives us a file with EOL=<LF> (bad)  gzip 'uncompress' 'ascii' of pc.gz gives us a file with EOL=<CR><CR> (bad)  gzip 'uncompress' 'ascii' of pca.gz gives us a file with EOL=<CR> (good!)I'm afraid that this is not fully supported in MacGzip. When uncompressing, it does the UNIX 0x0a (LF) to Mac 0x0d (CR) end-of-line conversion; but when compressing it does not change CR to LF. THIS IS A BUG in MacGzip 0.2.1 and earlier!!!!! (I hope this will be fixed soon)If you want to gzip an ASCII file and put it on an UNIX system you can:1: gzip your text file (mode does not mind). This give us a 'foo.txt.gz'2: transfer it to the Unix box (in binary mode!)3: execute the following Unix command:     gzip -dc foo.txt.gz | tr "\015" "\012" > foo.txt¥ My Mac-dhqx-application does not recognice gunziped files.A file with .hqx suffix IS A TEXT FILE; so it should be uncompressed in ASCII mode. This not only will put 'Macintosh end-of-lines' (which shouldn't make any difference to your debinhexer), but also will set the type of the resulting file to 'TEXT'.Anyway; if you have gunziped your foo.hqx in binary mode; you can use 'StuffIt Expander', since (in Drag&Drop mode) it eats any kind of file.¥ What is the meaning of 'binary' in 'gzip' menu?Binary means that you get a file which is exactly the same file (byte by byte) which was compressed; you should use this option for any non-text file.If you uncompress a binary file (like a file.tar.gz or a file.tif.gz) in ASCII mode; you will loose the file.If you uncompress a text file (like a file.hqx.gz or a text.gz) in binary mode; you can recover the file in several ways.¥ MacGzip reports a CRC error!This error appears when the file is corrupted or, most frequently, when the file has been incorrectly transferredGziped files ARE PURE BINARIES. (raw data, binary, not MacBinary nor ASCII)When you download a gif file; you set your communications software in binary mode; do the same with gziped files.Here you are a few hints:1: Fetch    Add the following entries to 'suffix mapping' preferences:       suffix   type    creator    name        transfer  as...        .gz     Gzip     Gzip     gziped           binary        .tgz    Gzip     Gzip     tar.gz           binary        .Z      ZIVU     Gzip     compressed       binary        .z      pZIP     Gzip     pkziped          binary2: Zterm (I'm not a Zterm user, so I'm not sure about this point)Add strings (using ResEdit or similar) to resources 'STR# 335' and 'STR# 330'Example:    For gzip files:    1GzipGzip.gz(Read ZTerm documentation for more information)3: Anarchie & Peter Lewis' ftpdThey use Fetch Preferences, so get Fetch, and go to point 1¥ Do you have a s-mail address?    Jose Antonio Gutierrez Elipe    Francisco Jose Seron Arbeloa    Centro Politecnico Superior Ingenieria Industrial               Universidad de Zaragoza    (Dpto.
