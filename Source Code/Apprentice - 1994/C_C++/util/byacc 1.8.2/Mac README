byacc 1.8.2 for the MacOSported by Brent Burton, brentb@tamsun.tamu.edu---------------------------------------------------------------Notes to the port:* ported to v. 5 of Think C, with very few modifications.* Project file has "Infer Prototypes" ON* #define MACINTOSH  so the few changes are local* See other macros in the project file (Cmd-; then select prefixes)Changes:main.c------* Use Think C console support* use an alternate temporary filename scheme than the original* misc little stuff that I can't remember now ;-)---------------------------------If you come across any problems in the executable (I haven't), letme know if it was due to me.  Otherwise contact the author ofbyacc.NOTE:  unlike GNU Bison, byacc does not hinder your generated sourcecode in any way.  Byacc (Berkeley-yacc) is a total rewrite of yaccby the friendly CS folks at Berkeley and is freely distributable.-Brent
