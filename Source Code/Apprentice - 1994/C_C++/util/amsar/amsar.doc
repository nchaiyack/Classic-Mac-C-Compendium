The archive files are suitable for transfering to floppy disks and/or compressingto save space.Some more complex examplesTransfer previous years to a floppy:amsar pack -delete mail mail.pak before jan-1-90Then ftp (MUST be transfered in binary mode) the file to say, a mac.Run stuffit and make a .sit file.Split it into floppy sized chunks.Using compress:amsar pack mail - subject bogus|compress > bogus.pak.Zamsar pack -delete mail - subject bogusNote due to the way vice stores happen the above amsar|compress should not bedone in one step since a vice crash might not leave eithor copy intact.Using uncompress:uncompress bogus.pak.Z|amsar unpack/create menus - from "food services"Transfer message on alt.sex from bruce and about decnet to my mailbox:amsar pack netnews.alt.sex - from bruce and subject decnet|amsar unpack mail - allDelete messages before 1990 not from cyert or libove:amsar pack -delete mail - before jan-1-90 and not \( from cyert or from libove \) > /dev/null  pack foldername outputfile expr  pack -delete foldername outputfile exprMessages from the named folder selected by expr are transfered to outputfile.If output file is - then output is to standard out and the chatty messagesmove to standard error.  pack -delete will make a second pass over the amsfolder and delete the selected messages after the output file has beensuccessfully closed (and stored to vice if it is a vice file).  -deleteand - should not generally be combined since a process further downstream in the the pipe might abort.  The foldername is found onyour mspath as specified in your prefrences.  If expr is notpresent it defaults to the expression 'all'.  unpack foldernaame infile exprMessages from the named infile are loaded into the ams folder foldername.Use - for infile to read from standard in.

That is the match is againstthe strings you see when displaying the captions list in a mail programNOT against the real data in the message.  So if the subject is cut becauseit is too long when viewing it in macmail for example then that data isnot available for matching either.  On the plus side it is many timesfaster this way.  If you sent a message ams puts the person it wassent to in the sender field preceded by "=>" example:=> A. Wohl@andrew.cmu.edThe text matches (subject and from) use the bsd regexp (re_comp,re_exec)regular expression matcher. Some examples:from ".*a.*n" - match names not starting with 'a' that have an 'a' preceded by an 'n'The following characters need to be quoted to amsar to not be considered regexpcharacters . * ( ) [ ] \Some of these also need to be quoteed to the shell, so to match a backslashin a subject:subject \\\\The text matches (subject and from) default to non case sensitive, use-yescase to make them case sensitive.  Example:amsar -yescase pack mail - from BobThe commands and operators themselves are always case insensitive.  Example:amsar -YESCASE PACK mail - froM BobHowever the foldername is parsed by ams and followes amses rules, whatever they are.In the default non case sensitive mode, both the string to match on the command lineand the string in the header are converted to lower case.  If the match pattern isreally regexp expression containing a character range spanning the lower andupper case characters (ie [Q-r] ) then the match results are unpredictable,(use yescase for such strange matches).Each term of an expression is one command line argument. So becarefull to quote multi word arguments to the shell for example:subject "meeting tuesday".  Likewise be sure to quote ( and ) example:not \( from aw0g or from advisor \)Also note the spaces before and after the parentheses.When an unpack or delete operation failes in the middle (say vice goes downwhen half the files are unpacked), the a mark may be left saying thatthe folder needs to be reconstructed the next time that folder isaccessed with amsar or any other ams client any temporary or partialycreated work will be cleaned up.If I pack then unpack a folder is it exactly the same?No, there are two differences:a) Each message lives in an individual file.  When you restore them you   are the last writer.  Before the sender of the message or postman   would most likely have been the writer.  If the message directory ever   becomes damaged and is reconstructed then due to a problem in the   directory rebuilder it may think you are trying to fake who sent the mail.   If this happens the captions may seem to all be from the person that   restored the mail.  This problem doesn't seem to happen with personal folders   only bboards.b) There is a table in the message directory of which messages are associated by   being replies to the same original message.  amsar uses some shortcuts in   unpacking messages and does not maintain this informaion.  No ams clients use   it currently so that should not be a problem.Written by:Aaron Wohl/Special Projects/Carnegie Mellon UniversitySpecial thanks to:Matt Sorrals/Special Projects/Carnegie Mellon University
