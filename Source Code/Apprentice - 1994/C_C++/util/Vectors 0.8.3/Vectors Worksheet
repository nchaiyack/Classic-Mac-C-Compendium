While all major features work, and seem to work well on the machines I have tested them on, there are a number of minor features not yet implemented. I’ll mention them as I go through the menus and give you a brief introduction to Vectors.	You should make a copy of this file and save it somewhere with a differentname. One way of doing this is to select the “Save a Copy” item from theFile Menu. Name the copy “Original Vectors Worksheet” or some such.File Menu	This is standard Mac stuff. Vectors will open any text file. Printing ispretty ordinary. There is no way to change print margins or lines per page.A short vertical line appears at the top of every text window which indicatesthe recommended right margin. Text wrapped to this width will be centered onthe printed page. Vectors prints the page number at the bottom of every page.		If you hold the option key down while selecting the Open menu item, thenall files, not just text files, are displayed and can be opened. Filesopened in this way are read only. You can copy data from them to theclipboard but not change them in any way.	The “Save” menu item is only activated when a file has been changed byadding or removing characters. The term “dirty” is commonly used todescribe text files in this state. Non-editing changes, such as changingthe font or adding a mark do not dirty a file. However, all such changes,even scroll position and selection range, are always saved to disk when youclose a file. So, don’t be surprised  by disk activity when you close afile in which you made no changes.Edit Menu	Shift Right and Shift Left add or remove one tab on each line or,when word wrap is in, each paragraph within the selection region. At the same time, it converts all space runs to the corresponding number of tabs. “Align” aligns all subsequent lines to the first line in the selection region. 	Check out the Undo function. It really works like it should. The Format dialog of the Edit Menu is where you select fonts and font size, turn word-wrapping on or off (on is the default), select tab width, and show or notshow invisible characters. These settings are remembered for each documentand retained between launches. (Naturally, this is a Mac.)	The “Format…” menu item calls a dialog for changing text font, textsize, and certain preferences. The “Show Invisibles” check box prints ‘¿’ for all non-printing characters, ‘∆’ for tabs, ‘¬’ for carriage returns, and ‘◊’ for spaces. Automatic word wrap can be turned off or on and madeto occur when text exceeds the width of the text’s window or a particularnumber of characters (Line Length). This line length parameter is also usedfor the “Hard Wrap to Length” item in the Convert Menu. The "Auto Indent"feature will look at the preceeding line, when word wrap is off, or para-graph, when word wrap is on, and indent each new line to align with it.Clicking the okay button (or typing the return or enter key) applies those settings to the front window. Clicking the cancel button (or typing escape or command-period) cancels the dialog and does not make any changes to thefront window. Clicking on the “All Files” button applies the settings tothe front window and saves them as default settings that will be appliedto all new windows and any foreign file that has not been previously opened by PlainText, MPW, Vectors, or Alpha. (Vectors shares a common method of saving window state with these other three text editors.)Find Menu	This all works. “Find…” and “Replace…” are pretty standard and prettyintuitive functions for text windows. The search string can be a selectionexpression, that is, an expression that contains wildcards. Try a searchusing *menu as the selection expression. Choose “Find…” and type “*menu”(with or without quotes) and click the “Selection Expression” radio button. Now click the Find button (or hit the return key). See how a line containing “menu” has been found? Command-G repeats the search.	If the selection expression is a number, it is interpreted as a line number. Try 87 as a selection expression.	This line, the 87th in this window, will be selected.	“Select Survey” is a way of selecting a particular survey in a mapwindow. It should be pretty clear from the layout of the dialog box how itworks.	If you hold down the shift key when you choose any of the Find menu items, then the search will be in the reverse direction. This is handiest when used in conjunction with the keyboard equivalents command-h and command-G. Mark Menu	Marks are like bookmarks that you can place in a text or map file sothat you can recall previous selections. When you select a mark from theMark Menu, the text or survey corresponding to that mark is selected and the window scrolls to show it. Marks the window size, current selection, and scrollbar position). You can add new marks with the Mark menu item and remove them with Unmark. You can alphabetize the order in which marks are displayed in the Mark Menu by selecting the Alphabetize menu item. Selecting it again restores the original order. Look at the Marks that I have madefor this file by opening the Marks Menu.Window Menu	Stack and Tile windows work, as does the rest, a catalog of openwindows. The menu item for the front window is checked. The target windowis indicated by the bullet symbol (•). Windows whose changes have notyet been saved to disk are underlined.View Menu	Only Enlarge and Reduce work here, and if you enlarge beyond a certainlimit, the display goes to pot. That’s a bug. Reports Menu	Log and Schematic reports are reports contained regular text windows. They can be edited, printed, and saved. Not all features of the rose diagramwindow are in place. It will produce a full rose diagram when a CML filehas been processed with Vector’s default settings. Data Menu	“Process” means process the top text window as a CML input file.	“Process Files” gives a dialog box into which you can type the names ofone or more files to be processed as CML files. 	For both “Process” and “Process Files,” the options selected in the “Options” dialog govern the way that the file(s) are processed. Not alloptions are available at this time. Clicking “Attributes” or any of thegraphics options (DXF, Postscript, or Super3D) will not affect the CMLoutput. The “More Options…” dialog is not yet implemented. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |    A hidden feature is that if you hold down the shift key when you    | |  choose either Process or Process Files menu items, then no CML        | |  processing is done. Instead, the command line that would have been    | |  passed to CML is pasted into the Vectors Worksheet window. This may   |  |  help you understand some of the command line options of CML.          | --------------------------------------------------------------------------	“Title Page” and “Data Page” invoke the data entry windows. Every timeyou select “Next Page,” the content of the active data-entry window istranslated into CML and pasted into the text window that is associated withthat data-entry window. The associated text window is the one that wastop-most when Data Page or Title Page menu item was selected. “PreviousPage,” “First Page,” and “Last Page” don’t work yet. Use the tab, enter orreturn key (or the mouse) to advance to the next field. The data page windowautoincrements station names every time you hit one of keys. I made thiswindow to fit my way of entering data. First enter the stations so that they look just like what is on survey book page. Then go to the first distanceand enter it. As you hit enter, you advance through the numerical fields:distance, fore-azi, back-azi, etc. Finally use the mouse to move the insertion point to the first wall dimension. Type it in. Hitting enteradvances through the dimension fields now. All numerical data entry canbe done just using the keypad. See what happens when fore- and backsightdon’t agree. 	Two data entry templates are supplied. You choose between them, or anycustom format you might design, using the “Select Template” menu item. The CRF template is the format used at Mammoth Cave and is a good example of a book format that uses a staggered of data fields. The template labeled “CRF-West” is a straight-forward rectangular format. To design your own, choose the “Edit/View Template” menu item. Template design is so intuitive, I am not even going to explain how to do it. Just try it. 	The text editor built into Vectors is a very good one. Besides beingfast and able to handle even very large files, it also has some built-infeatures:	1.	Double-clicking selects a whole word.	2.	Triple-clicking selects a whole line.	3.	Double clicking on a bracket or parenthesis (i.e. “[”, “{”, etc.) 		causes all the text between the bracket or parenthesis and its 		matching bracket or parenthesis to become selected.	4.	Cutting, pasting, and undoing are fully implemented.	5.	The arrow keys work to move the insertion point or selection (hold		the shift key down) in the expected ways.	6.	Command-option-uparrow move the insertion point to the top of the		file. Command-option-downarrow does the opposite. Holding the shift		key down while doing either of these extends the selection to either		the top or bottom of the document.	7.	It is a command-line interpreter in its own right. However, right		now, “CML” is the only command it understands. Select the following		whole line (or place the insertion point anywhere within it):			CML -1 -h -o Rotunda.crf 		and hit the enter key (not the return key). Vectors processes the 		file Rotunda.crf (distributed as an example along with Vectors) for		a few moments. You will then find a file Rotunda.crf.out on you disk.		Open it and you will see a nice report of the surveys in it. Welcome		to CML. 		Because the “Options” and “More Options” dialogs are not yet finished,		this is the only way to access many of CML’s more advanced features,		such as the production of Postscript or DXF files.		The following commands can be executed from any text window: 		ls (same as dir in DOS), cd (change directory), open, target,		find, line. Open opens the named file and makes it the front window.		File is similar except the window is made the target window (second		from front). “line n” selects selects the nth line of the target		window (n is a number. “Find exp” searchs the target window for the		string “exp.” Wildcards can be used with the find and ls commands,		just as you would expect in DOS.		In summary, hitting the enter key causes the current line or current 		selection, whichever is smaller, to be interpreted as a command line.		Commands implemented:			cd			Change default directory (folder). Note, the Mac 						file system uses the colon to designate the present 						or higher folders. Thus “cd ::” changes the default						directory one level up.			chcre		Change a file’s creator. For example, 						chcre 'MRPH' 'Current File' makes Vectors the						creator of the file named ‘Current File.’			chtyp		Change the file type of a file, using the same						syntax (chtyp type filename) as chcre.			cml			process a cml file.			file		Open a file and make it the target			find ss		Find a string in the target window			ls			List a directory’s contents			ls -l		Give a full listing of a directory’s contents			line nn		Select line nn in the target window			open ff		Open a file			stats		Prints the statistics of the target windowTarget Window	Note that the “line” and “find” comands operate on the TARGET window. The target window is the window behind the front-most window.Large Files	Vectors must load it’s text files entirely into memory. If you getan out-of-memory error message when trying to open a very large file, justincrease the partition (in the Finder’s Get-Info box for Vectors) to be larger than the file being opened. In System 7, turn on virtual memoryif necessary.A short working session	Suppose you have a survey book that you want to enter into Vectors andprocess. Create a new text window by selecting the New item of the FileMenu. Now select the Title Page item from the Data Menu. Type in thepertinent information, such as date, name of cave, etc. Now select eitherthe Data Page or Next Page option from the Data Menu. (When a title page isthe front window, they both do the same thing.) Enter the first stationname, such as “A1” and then hit the enter, tab, or return key. Notice thatyou are tabbing down the station column. Autosequencing is always and youjust re-type any station name that is incorrect. When all the stations on apage are entered, move to the first distance box, using the mouse. Juststart typing the data, in the order distance, foresight, backsight, foreinclination, back inclination. Hit the tab (or enter key) twice to skip afield. Vectors will warn you in a very friendly way if there is a conflictin the data. When through with the shot data, move the mouse to the firstwall dimension box, if you want to enter wall dimensions. Enter them. Whenyou are through with a data page, select Next Page (command-e) from theData Menu. Each time you do this, the contents of the current data page aretranslated into CML and pasted into the text window associated with thedata page. When finished with all the data pages, click in the underlyingtext window and inspect the data in its CML form. Make any further editingchanges that you want, such as inserting comments. Save the file. You don’thave to close a window to save its contents. Now, select the Options itemfrom the Data menu and be sure the options selected are what you want. Thedefault is to process all the information in the file and close loops. Ifthe options are okay, the select the Process item of the Data Menu. Thespinning cursor tells you that Vectors is working on the data. Whenfinished, check for any error messages in this window then open the filethat has the letters “.bin” appended to the name of the new file youcreated. You should see a line plot of your data.A few more examples:	The “Vectors Worksheet” is actually a CML input file, with one surveybook’s data appearing below. Everything above the data is either a comment(to the right of a “;”) or bracketed by “noprocess” and “process”directives. The data were typed in usings Vectors’ data entry windows anddon’t look too pretty because Vectors doesn’t yet process tab characters ina text window to my pleasing. Let’s fix that. Select “Options” from thedata menu. Note that the “Calculate and close loops” radio button isselected. There are no loops in this survey, but it doesn’t hurt to do theextra work. Click in the “Write reports to disk” check box and then in thenow activated “Pretty print” check box. Click on the “Done” button to closethe dialog. Now select “Process” from the Data Menu. Wait for Vectors tofinish. Two new files have been created. Open the one called “VectorsWorksheet.bin.” Nice map, eh? Open the one called “Vectors Worksheet.out.”It is a duplicate of this window except that the numerical data have beennicely columnated.	Open the BuffaloCreek.bin file to see Vectors graphical display. Wewill make a similar file of the much larger Rotunda.crf data set. Open theRotunda.crf file. This is a medium-sized file that covers most of thepassages near the Historic Entrance of Mammoth Cave. Reopen the “Options”dialog box and deselect “Write reports to disk.” Choose the process item ofthe data menu. When processing is complete, open the file “Rotunda.bin” tosee the complete line plot. Enlarge it (command-E) several times and scrollaround the map. Place the cursor over a passage and select it by clickingthe mouse button. You will see that selected passages are draw with a thickbroken line. (Each line break is a station.) Note that the survey name isdisplayed in the small floating window. Type command-K to see a schematicof that passage. Click back in the map window to make it the front-mostagain (or select it using the Windows menu). Type command-L to learn alittle bit more about that survey.Bug Reports	Send comments and complaints to:		Mel Park		1541 Peabody Avenu		Memphis, TN 38104		(901) 272-9393		(901) 448-5984		mpark@nb.utmem.eduDistribution files:	Accompaning Vectors is this file, “Vectors Worksheet,” thedocumentation files “CMLNotes.txt,” “CMLBook.txt,” and “CML Postings.”There are two example CML files, “Rotunda.crf” and “BuffaloCreek.crf,” abinary snapshot of the latter, “BuffaloCreek.bin,” and a file, “MapFrame.ps”that Vectors uses when the -ps option is used. When there is no “VectorsWorksheet” in the same folder as Vectors, then one is created. You willwant to customize your Worksheet file to contain useful facts andsample commands. Finally, there is a utility for converting SMAPS AsciiDump files to CML and an example SMAPS file to try it on.
