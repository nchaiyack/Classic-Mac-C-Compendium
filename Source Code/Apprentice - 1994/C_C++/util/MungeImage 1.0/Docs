This mounts DiskCopy images as disk icons.
It's free, do whatever you want with it.

To get rid of them, throw them in the trash.

Hints & Tips:
  Don't eject the disk(s).
  It won't work in System 6.
  Requires as much memory as mounted disk space.
  Background only version can't mount images after it is launched.
  Foreground version has *no* user interface.
