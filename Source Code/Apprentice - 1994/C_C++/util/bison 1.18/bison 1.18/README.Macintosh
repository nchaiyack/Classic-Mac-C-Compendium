Information file for Macintosh changes:This archive includes full original source and the Think C 5 projectneeded to build Bison 1.18.  It also includes a precompiled application,ready to roll.  Please see the COPYING file for details about whatyou are allowed to do to the code, and other licensing information.This port runs under MacOS by itself.  There is a MPW port availablealready at ftp sites, but *this* port does not need MPW.There were several changes to the code; all were minor and easily done.I made all previous K&R-style variable argument function use *real*variable arguments;  I feel this was one major update needed, ratherthan some K&R *hack*.  Otherwise, the only other changes were simplyusing Think C's routines in place of traditional UNIX calls ( fixingmktemp() to tmpnam(), etc.).In the Think C project, there are two libraries I need to say somethingabout:  UNIX_4byte and ANSI_4byte.  These are the standard ANSI andUNIX libraries, but compiled with 4-byte integers.  Make copies of yourexisting UNIX and ANSI libraries, then recompile them with 4-byte ints.To use this, copy the Bison 1.18 application and the bison parserskeletons (bison.simple and bison.hairy) to their final destination(put them in your development tools directory, if you keep thingsorganized like that -- I do).  Anyway, the application and its skeletonfiles *must* be in the same directory, wherever it is.I'm glad I could do this; enjoy!-Brentbpb9204@tamsun.tamu.edu
