Thanks to Bill Johnston (johnston@minnie.me.udel.edu) fortesting and many helpful suggestions.This program and source code is in the public domain.---To use:1) Launch "unshar"2) select "Extract"3) choose a shar archive that you've downloaded   (must be a text file).4) select a FOLDER in which to store the extracted files5) pick next archive or quitFor batch unsharing:1) under 7.0, select a group of files (must be TEXT files)   and drop them into unshar when the appl's icon is   highlighted.2) under pre-7.0 systems, select the TEXT files and the appl   itself, then choose "Open" from the file menu.Of course, if the file isn't a shar archive, ...   Not all shar files can be processed by this application,but it will work for the ones in the sumex archives andthose in comp.binaries.mac.This was built from source code posted by Amanda Walker ofIntercon.---Notes for hackers:The same source file can be used for both MPW and Think C.For use with Think C, you need  a) TC 4.0.4 or later  b) the header files distributed on the 7.0B4 CD  c) TransSkel (from sumex)If you use the header files distributed with TC 4.0, you may findthings like "FileFilterProcPtr" not defined. Just typedef them toProcPtrs and it should compile. Also look at the comment aboutLOWMEM vars near the top of the file.For MPW, use the unshar.make that is provided; you can use theBuild command in the Build menu.---Sak WathanasinNetwork Analysis Limiteduucp:	...!ukc!nan!swother:	sw@network-analysis-ltd.co.ukphone:  (+44) 203 419996snail:  178 Wainbody Ave South, Coventry CV3 6BX, UK
