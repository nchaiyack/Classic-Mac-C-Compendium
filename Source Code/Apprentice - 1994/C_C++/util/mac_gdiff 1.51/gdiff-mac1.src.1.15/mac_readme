gdiff is a macintosh port of the gnu diff utility.  You can run it and give anormal unix input line such as:gdiff +recursive boot:dir1 boot:dir2to the console command dialog.  Hit return for the list of options.You can also make a gnu diff command file that you can double click on.-Create a macintosh TEXT file with your faviorite text editor, I use think c The file should have one line like this: gdiff +recursive boot:dir1 boot:dir2 > gdiff.output-Examine the file with resedit, resourcerer, or fedit Change the the creator to GnuD (case sensitive) You may need to check 'not inited' when changing this for the finder to notice it.-Then you can double click on this file and it will run gnu diffAdditional options available in the command file only:> redirect to an output file, if you use the dialog you need to pick  the output file with the button.>+ Redirect but don't echo to the console for speed>+! (exclamation point) exit without pausing to hit return at the end.So a "normal" gdiff command file would be:gdiff +recursive boot:dir1 boot:dir2 >+! boot:dir_diffSources and executables are available on host akutaktak.andrew.cmu.edu[128.2.35.1] in the /aw0g directory as:gdiff-1.15.tar - original gnu diff as I got it off of prep.ai.mit.edugdiff-mac1.1.15.hqx   - binary distribution of macintosh gnu diff mac version     in binhex formatgdiff-mac1.src.1.15.tar - source distribution of macintosh gnu diff  mac version 1AUTHOR:  GNU diff - unknown possibly rms  Macintosh port - Aaron Wohl aw0g+@andrew.cmu.eduBUGS:The mac user interface is *really* badPatch hasn't been ported yet to go with itBUILDING FROM SOURCES:-Compiler required thinkc 5.0 In the think c directory make a copy of ANSI called ANSI-i4BIG, copy unix to unix-i4BIG Open both of these projects and change the following:   under project type set far code and far data   under prefrences      define __STDC__      infer prototypes      4byte integers (important!)  	  optimize  	    automatic register yes  	    global optimizer on-open the mac_gdiff.prj and build the application
