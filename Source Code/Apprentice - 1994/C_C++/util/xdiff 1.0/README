XDIFF

XDIFF/XFIX is a set of programs for quickly determining the changes
which were made during an editing session on a text file.
Those changes are written to an update file by XDIFF and then 
uploaded or transferred to a remote computer and the new file
is reassembled with XFIX.  Checksumming is used to guarantee that
the new file is correct after being updated.

The Source folder contains Macintosh and Unix system source code.
Use the makefile for Unix systems, the xdiff.make build file for 
MPW C 3.0.

These programs and documentation are in the public domain.
