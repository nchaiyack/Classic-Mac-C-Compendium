CommentConverter 1.0.0======================This is a little D&D that converts C-style comments to C++-style comments and vice versa. Your files should remain untouched, and new files with the same names but with the extension ". b" or ".d" (for files ".c"), ".g" or ".i" (for files ".h") will be created. To convert toC-style simply hold down the Option Key while dropping the files.DRAWBACKS:============I did not bother to cater for comments in parantheses, so   printf ("/*"); /* This will lead to errors!!!*/will be converted to:  printf ("//"); /* This will lead to errors!!!Nested Comments are not treated separately, thus   /* This comment will //look like this after conversion*/will result in:  /* This comment will /*look like this after conversion*/*/.To avoid this if converting to C-style comments first convert to C++-style commentsyielding //...//, which will be correctly translated to /* // */.Only 8 files may be dropped at the same time (see constant maxFiles in Apple.h). VERSION HISTORY:================1.0.0 (December 20, 1993) -=- initial release.COPYRIGHT NOTICES:==================CommentConverter 1.0.0 and the included sources and libraries are copyright ©1993 Andreas Amoroso (parts are copyright Symantec).
