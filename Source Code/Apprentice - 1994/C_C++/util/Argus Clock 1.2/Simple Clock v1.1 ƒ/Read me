CLOCK v1.2
written by Mark Butkiewicz

CLOCK is a simple, but useful little clock.  It's shareware, but
the fee is low ($2.50).

CLOCK uses a minimum of:
			- Desk Space
			- Disk Space
			- Memory Space
			- CPU Time

For those of you who like the simple things in life...CLOCK is for
you!

Since CLOCK is a simple application, it is virtually bullet-proof.
However, there is no expressed or implied warranty as to the
performance of the software.
