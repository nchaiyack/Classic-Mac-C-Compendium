This would make it easier toevaluate the functionality of a particular class."?  The main reason thatauthors do not include a demo is the time it costs to code one. However,David Harkness and Brian Hamlin started the Showcase Application projectin May '92 to solve just this problem.Showcase is an small application framework for building a demonstrationapplication. Showcase is easy to use, lightweight, and even works as aframework within which to debug your classes.
