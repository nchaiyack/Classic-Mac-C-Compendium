/*   All:

  Recently, Daryl Spitzer (Daryl_Spitzer@mindlink.bc.ca) and 
Jamie McCarthy (k044477@kzoo.edu) asked if anyone was interested in 
a coupl'a classes they had written.

  (Now "Kenny Bob (M.K.) Edwards" <medwards@astro.Princeton.EDU>, also)

  It seems like it would be fun, and not too much work, to make an
Application that shows off various parts people have contributed
and at the same time provide real, working examples of usage
and benefits. 

  It is also an ideal "group project". One that can be broken down
into realistic and manageable parts, could benefit anyone interested 
in the subject and would encourage others to make something, too.

  Plus, if we can get Jamie to work on it, you know it'll be awsome  ;-)

  It seems like with a bit of initial push, it could get rolling.
From there, things could be added really easily. In fact, concentrating
on making it *really* easy would be part of the benefit. Not in the way 
of automated this & that, but rather Keeping It Simple.

  Personally, I like to draw pictures. So I could do some backdrops
and/or launching areas for example windows.

  On a related subject, I've noticed that that basic project has gotten
to be quite large. Having to add SANE to use DLOGDialogs *really* got 
to me. I wonder if things could be trimmed down at all ? 

  I've gotten used to DLOGDialogs and think they are the "right thing",
so we can't toss that out ! But maybe others have ideas..

  So, What do people think of a Showcase Application ? The code would be 
maintained at Brown I'd guess, since thanks to Andrew this list got its
start there.

  Ok, Ok, here it is. The sample application from which all other
  Very Cool net hacks can be launched. Check it out.
  
  This could be fun, folks.
 
 
  BUGS:  Right now, I got the Table in, reading from the resources,
  but the click isn't being accepted. After that, the command 
  number (the first long in the resource), has to be looked 
  up in CSTable::DoCommand() and executed, with the author of
  the sample piece of code filling it in there. (see listing)
  
  Fix this before I Goof Off again !!

/**********************************************************************

	All right, I've fixed some bugs and changed a few (?) methods
	here and there.  First major changed is from Demo Command Numbers
	to using the nifty new_by_name feature.  This brought two immediate
	benefits that I could see:
	
	1)	No one has to worry about duplicating someone else's cmdNo.
	2)	CSApplication.c doesn't need to be modified at all to add in
		new demos.  (Y E S !)  Instead, I created a CShowcaseDemoDir
		class from which all demos will be subclassed.  When the user
		selects a demo, new_by_name is used on the Demo Class Name
		and then it is sent the INewDemo message.  Just override it
		to create your demo.
	
	Also, I added two example demos.  CScrollList is a class I wrote
	to replace CTable for scrolling lists.  I was sick of using Cells
	when I only needed one column (which was every time I used it),
	and I didn't need multiple selections.  This simplified it greatly.
	I included it only as an example.  I'm still adding new things to
	it, but I could use _any_ input whatsoever.  The documentation is
	weak at best, but it's pretty self-explanatory (except for the
	kSLEditable option -- good luck figuring that one out :)  Try it
	out, and P L E A S E send me some feedback.  Thanks!
	
	The second is CTreeViewer, which I picked up (I believe) on either
	America Online or Sumex.  Anyway, it's a cool class from David
	Wagner that shows a tree of all subviews of a view or the entire
	chain of command (from a CBureaucrat on up) or a list of all of
	a view's enclosures.  It's a nice debugging tool.  The docs didn't
	mention an address or anything for him, but I hope he doesn't mind.
	
	That's it.  I'd just like to say one thing
	
		Let's keep this thing rolling!
	
	Thank you.
