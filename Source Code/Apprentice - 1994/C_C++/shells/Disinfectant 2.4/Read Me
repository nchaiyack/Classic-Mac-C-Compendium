Disinfectant 2.4 Sample Source Code===================================Folder 'Source Code'--------------------This folder contains the complete source code for the Disinfectant 2.4sample program.  It was derived from Disinfectant by removing all of the virus detection and repair code and substituting code to simply enumerate a directorylisting.If you would like to begin investigating the sample code, I suggest that youstart with the makefile.The source code is in MPW 3.1 C and Assembler.The virus detection and repair code is not available to the public.Folder 'MacHack Talk'---------------------This folder contains a handout for a talk I gave at MacHack '90 and to severallocal Chicago-area groups on the online manual and help system in Disinfectant 2.0.Folder 'Notes'--------------This folder contains two notes I posted to comp.sys.mac.programmer afterwriting Disinfectant 1.0.  ======================I hope that you find this stuff useful.  Feel free to use any of this code inyour own projects, provided you give appropriate credit in your about box ormanual to John Norstad and Northwestern University.John NorstadAcademic Computing and Network ServicesNorthwestern University2129 Sheridan RoadEvanston, IL 60208 USAInternet: jln@acns.nwu.eduBitnet: jln@nuaccAmerica Online: JNorstadCompuServe: 76666,573AppleLink: A0173
