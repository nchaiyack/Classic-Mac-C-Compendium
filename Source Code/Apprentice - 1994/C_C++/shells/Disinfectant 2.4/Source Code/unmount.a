; This routine is used to patch the UnmountVol trap when the standard
; save file dialog is presented if the report becomes full during a
; disk scan.  It simply returns to the caller with the function result
; noErr, preventing the volume unmount.  (See routine DoSave in main.c).
;
; The problem is that the standard file package attempts to unmount
; volumes before returning to the caller.  We must prevent this during
; disk scans.
;
; Entry:	(a0) = pointer to parameter block.
;
; Exit:		(d0) = function result = noErr.
