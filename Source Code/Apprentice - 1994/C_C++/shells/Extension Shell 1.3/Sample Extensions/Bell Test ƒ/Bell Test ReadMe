Bell Test
---------

Bell Test is one of the sample INITs from Eric Shapiro's July 1993 BYTE Article. It's available in its
original form as:

It is an example of using Extension Shell to install a trap patch, extend the address table, and load and
call a block of code in the System Heap. The net effect is to make the Mac play a sound when About... is
selected from the Apple menu. While it might look more complex than the other extensions, there's
not a lot different. It installs _two_ code resources, not one, and it uses a custom version of the
CODE 5002 resource (i.e., the Address table).

The trap patch is a tail patch to MenuSelect. Read ÔTail-patching under System 7Õ to see why this is OK
under System 7.
