Subject: Some details on tail patching under System 7

It appears that many people are still uncertain if it is okay to install a tail patch under System 7.  Here are
a few words on the subject from some mail I sent to Bill Walburg regarding his question on tail patching.

To the best of my knowledge, you may Tail-patch every trap in System 7 _except_ for FrontWindow.  I'm
not sure why that one is special; Dean Yu just said "don't do it".

System 7 has a new improved SetTrapAddress/GetTrapAddress mechanism that allows tail patching.  This
mechanism did not exist in System 6. It works through a little bit of magic.  System come-from patches
(the icky bug fixes that made tail patching inadvisable under System 6) are installed in a special magic way
by the system.  They also include special magic that allows the system to determine if there is a
come-from patch at the head of the trap pointer, and if there is, the system can get _and change_ the
address of the routine that will be executed after the come-from patch.

If your trap patch is not installed using the special system magic (and it shouldn't be), then GetTrapAddress
will return to you the address of the first function _after_ all of the come-from patches, and
SetTrapAddress will install your routine _after_ all of the come-from patches.  Thus, your trap patch will
not be "in the way" when the come-from patch is snooping up the stack.

Don't try this under any System prior to System 7.

The mythical Layer Manager has a come from patch on FrontWindow that will not call through in some
cases, so if you patch FrontWindow, your patch may not fire.  It's probably not worth the effort to try to
work around it.
