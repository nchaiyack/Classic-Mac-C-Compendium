CircleMouse ][--------------CircleMouse is a module from Mark Pilgrim's MouseBroken Control Panel. Soure code to the original modulecomes with the MouseBroken Control Panel package. You can find the MouseBroken package as:			sumex-aim.stanford.edu::/info-mac/dev/src/mouse-broken-101-c.hqxIt is an example of using Extension Shell to install a VBL task - the task it installs makes the mouse cursormove in a circle when the  mouse button is held down. I added an extra check so that the VBL task onlydoesn't do anything if the Caps lock key is down... otherwise it was just *impossible* to test... :-)
