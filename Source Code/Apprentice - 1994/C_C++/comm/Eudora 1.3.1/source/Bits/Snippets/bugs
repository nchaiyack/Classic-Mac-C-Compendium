PLEASE REPORT EUDORA-RELATED CRASHES, BUGS, AND THERMONUCLEAR WARI expect this version to be relatively bug-free. However, I can't test all situations or Macintosh configurations. If you experience a crash, I'd like to hear about it. Send mail to eudora-bugs@qualcomm.com; tell me what kind of mac you have, what version of Eudora you're using, what you did, what happened, and what (if any) error messages Eudora gave. If you're running MacsBug, I'd like to see how, dm 910, sc, sc7, hc, ht, ip, and dm sp 200 if you had a crash (see 'help log' in macsbug). If you have suggestions or other comments about Eudora, please send them directly to me, Steve Dorner, sdorner@qualcomm.com.
