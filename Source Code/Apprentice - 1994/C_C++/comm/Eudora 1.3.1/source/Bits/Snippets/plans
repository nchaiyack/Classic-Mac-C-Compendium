FUTURE PLANSEudora version 2.0 will have support for MIME (the new internet standard that allows for pictures, sound, rich text, national character sets and file transfer in mail, all in a standard way), AppleEvents (so that Eudora can be used by other programs who want to send mail), and possibly a remote mailbox protocol like IMAP or PCMail. Eudora 2.0 will be able to use pattern matching and a rules database for automated sorting, filing, and handling of mail. I'll also be keeping an eye on OCE developments. I have no estimate for a release date for Eudora 2.0.
