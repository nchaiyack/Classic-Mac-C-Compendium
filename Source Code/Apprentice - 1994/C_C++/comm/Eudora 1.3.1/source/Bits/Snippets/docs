DOCUMENTATIONIf you get Eudora from the ftp sites, the documentation is provided in two forms; the PageMaker 4.0 original, and the PostScript output from that file. It is provided in PostScript format and on paper if you order Eudora by mail.To print the PostScript files, you will need the LaserWriter Utility. You can get this by anonymous ftp to ftp.apple.com, dts/mac/sys.soft/imaging/laserwriter-utility.hqx. The file "1.3Changes" summarizes the differences between Eudora 1.2.2 and Eudora 1.3. The Q&A stack has all sorts of interesting tidbits, including information on customizing Eudora. Finally, Eudora has extensive Balloon Help.
