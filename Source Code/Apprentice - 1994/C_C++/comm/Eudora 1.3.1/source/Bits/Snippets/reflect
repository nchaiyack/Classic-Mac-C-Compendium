EMAIL REFLECTOR STACKThis is a HyperCard stack that allows you to maintain one or more sendmail alias files in your home directory on your POP server. With this stack and a little connivance from your systems administrator, you can manage mail reflectors all from the privacy of your own Macintosh. (A mail reflector is an address that sends all the mail it receives to a list of people. It's sort of like a Eudora group nickname, except that anyone can use it, not just you.) MacTCP required.
