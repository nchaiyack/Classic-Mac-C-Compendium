VACATION INSTALLERThis is a HyperCard stack that allows you to install or remove a "vacation" message, if your POP server runs UNIX and supports vacation. (Vacation is a program that automatically notifies people who send you mail that you're off gallivanting instead of answering your mail. You still get the mail.) MacTCP required.
