These are the default macros for Terminal 2.0. Modify them (with a TEXT
editor) to suit your own needs.

\mName of the first macro
This is the text of the first macro. As you see you can include carriage
returns by going to the next line. If you want to use the backlash
character use this: \\. Control characters can be entered using the
backlash. E.g. Control-G is \g. If you want your macro to end with a
carriage return include a blank line before the next macro name or the end
of the file, like this.

\mSecond macro
This is the text of the second macro.

\mDial BeachBox
ATDPATDP398144

\mReset Modem
ATZ

\mDirectory
DIR DES AGE:31

\mLast macro
There can be up to ten different macros in a set, but you need not use all
ten entries.
