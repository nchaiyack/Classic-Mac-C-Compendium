/* * find the driver number of the softkiss driver * by Aaron Wohl (aw0g+@andrew.cmu.edu) jul 1990 * Carnegie-Mellon University * Special Projects * Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890 * (412)-268-5032 * * special thanks to Luni and Rich Brown @ Dartmouth * * Luni wrote the MacTCP emulator for macmach from which this file * borrows liberaly. * * Rich Brown provided the source to Dartmouth's BlitzNotify installer * which was a big help. * * Unlike other softkiss source files which are for THINK C compilation * only, this module compiles with MPW c also. * So be carefull about sizeof(int) in THINK == 2 * and sizeof(int) in MPW == 4 if you make any changes. * */#include "sfk_codecheck.h"#include "sfk_drvr_find.h"#define drvrName 18		/*length byte and name of driver [string]*//* * returns the refnum of the passed driverName * or zero if it isn't installed.
