/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------	ldefstub.c	This module contains a stub for NewsWatcher's LDEF.		This module is compiled by the ldef.¹ project to build the stand-alone	LDEF 128 resource.		This is only a very small stub used to call the main LDEF function in	the ldef.c module, which is part of the main newswatcher.¹ project.		A pointer to the main LDEF function must be stored in the list record's	refcon field.		Using the stub has two advantages:		1. The main LDEF function can use global variables, call other functions,	and in general enjoy all the privileges of a "real" function as opposed	to a function in a stand-alone code resource.		2. We don't have to remember to rebuild the stand alone LDEF resource	whenever we make changes to the data structures in glob.h.	----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/typedef void (*listDefFuncType) (short, Boolean, Rect *, Cell,	short, short, ListHandle);pascal void	main (short lMessage, Boolean lSelect, Rect *lRect, Cell lCell,	short lDataOffset, short lDataLen, ListHandle lHandle){	listDefFuncType listDefFunc;		if (lMessage == lInitMsg) return;	listDefFunc = (listDefFuncType)(**lHandle).refCon;	(*listDefFunc)(lMessage, lSelect, lRect, lCell, lDataOffset, lDataLen, lHandle);}
