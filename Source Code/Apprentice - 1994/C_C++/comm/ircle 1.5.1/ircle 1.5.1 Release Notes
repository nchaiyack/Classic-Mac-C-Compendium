-----------------------ircle 1.5.1 Release Notes-----------------------This comes much too late, but it contains some important changes and improvements.First of all, the handling of the Preferences file has been changed - it is now a text file, much like NCSA Telnet's sets. You can edit this for autostart commands like a Un*x .ircrc. The windows along with size and positions, as well as notify and ignore lists, are stored with the other options in this file (choose "Save Set" from the menu and take a look at the resulting file). Old-style prefs files are supported for reading only and can be converted.The non-obvious problems with 2.8 servers have been fixed. DCC works again. Support for CTCP PING added. New command CPING to ping other user.Now handles styles in windows. SERVER command should work. Windows don't auto-scroll as long as the Shift key is pressed.New command: SHOW <comm> [ON|OFF] lets you suppress output from certain status changes such as JOIN, LEAVE (I added this feature after a long day on #report during the Moscow coup on Oct.4 :-)1.3.5-----------------------This is largely a maintenance release, to fix a large number of bugs and accomplish full compliance with the new 2.8 server release and the protocol now defined in RFC 1459. The promised revamping of the input line and prefs file handling had to be postponed…New features:- LIST exclusion options (just like ircII)- \n in a shortcut will translate to a CR- SERVER command to change servers- CMDCHAR command to set command prefix to other than /Fixes and improvements:- silly performance hog taken out (should run faster now)- commands may now be abbreviated- MSG works now (why has only one person noticed the bad screwup? :-)- Confusions with NOTIFY and KICK, the input line and message direction solved- Network connection handling improved - should give right error indication now- User interface clenaed up a bit: Cmd-, omits input line, text selection won't be killed by new messages arriving1.2.6---------------------New command:/notify nick - gives message when nick signs on/off (see docs)Improved:- Window zooming works now- Input line uses standard editing functions- Updated to new TCP libraries (thanks Peter)- use different (better) ISO conversion tables, also by Peter- added some numerics and diagnostic infoBugs fixed:- TYPE protocol error (but I recommend against using TYPE at all)- messages in wrong windows (again...)- NAMES works w/o argument 1.14---------------------This fixes a number of bugs, mostly related to messages appearing in the wrong windows. Other fixes:- Connection dropping crashes- PART sometimes does not close window- broken WHO with * wildcards- instabilities in DCC connection close handling- Window menu items get not deletedNow that I finally got a color screen, I've added color icons. :-)Window zooming has been taken out as it was broken anyway.1.10---------------------A new command has been added:/broadcast message - sends message to all your active windows.1.0---------------------This is the first one I dare to call 1.0, because most of the features required in a modern client are now implemented and the most notable bugs of the pre-releases are taken out. However, there may still be bugs in this program. If you find them, contact me.This differs from the pre-releases in many ways. It now features full (well, almost) CTCP and DCC support along with a new feature not present even in IRCII: text mode DCC file transfer.A new /ignore command has been added, also a /type for typing files to a channel.A serious source of confusion has been fixed by adding a /help command.Some parts of the user interface are cleaner, esp. the input line. The menus are set up in a more standard-Mac fashion.Now there is a font selection menu. The code has been cleaned up in many places, increasing speed and decreasing memory consumption.Now there is a User's Manual, into which much of the online help has been moved.The source code should be available in the same places as the compiled program. I still use THINK Pascal 2.01 but newer versions should do as well.This program should work on any Mac with System ≥ 6.0 and MacTCP ≥ 1.0. It does not support AppleEvents under System 7 (but works well without them). It can run in 32-bit mode.This client implements only the commands and messages that are valid in the 2.7 server release. By now, all older servers should be taken out of the network.Olaf Titz (s_titz@ira.uka.de)
