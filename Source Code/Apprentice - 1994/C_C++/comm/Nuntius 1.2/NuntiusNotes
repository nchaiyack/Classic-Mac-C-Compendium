Please write some better documentation for me...When choosing server:	option key will avoid check of server (will not try to open connection)	you can specify port number after the servername like in telnet	Copy text:	option key: unquoted text	shift key: no attribution line (In article xxx, yyy wrote)Update List Of All Groups:	option key: will rebuild list and remove deleted groupsExtract binaries when viewing list of threads	option key: will not extract the selected threads as one thread	New discussion, Follow-up and Reply-by mail	Selected text will be placed in article/letter as quote	Same option/shift effect as in copy textSmall left/right arrows in article window	the arrow keys left and right...magic key: space	In group lists:		opens selection and moves selection to next group with new articles		In list of threads:		opens selection if any		else pages down is possible		else closes window		In article window: (same as the little arrow down)		pages down is possible		else goes to next selected thread if any (same as arrow right)		else closes windowOpen special:	Grouplists in the same folder as your "Nuntius Preferences" folder	is displayed in this list.Several people can keep their own settings by making their own copyof the "Nuntius personal files" folder and launching Nuntius by double-clicking on the "Nuntius Preferences" document.Same method if you want to use more than 1 server: Move the "Nuntius personal files" folder out of the preferences folder and launchNuntius by double clicking the Nuntius application. You will now haveanother "Nuntius personal files" folder in the preferences folder.If the "Nuntius personal files" folder in the Preferences folder is replacedby a document, Nuntius can only be used by double-clicking a Preferencesdocument.  (all just like Eudora).
