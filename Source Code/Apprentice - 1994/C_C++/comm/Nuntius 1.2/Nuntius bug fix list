______________________________________________________________NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTEPlease: Do not send me personal letters with questions, etc.There are two mailing lists about Nuntius.  NUNTIUS-L is forquestions, answers and general discussion.  NUNTIUS-ANNOUNCE-Lis a moderated, low traffic list for announcements ONLY (suchas for new versions, bugs, etc.).  All messages to theannouncement list are cross-posted to the discussion list.To subscribe to the lists, send the following in the body of amessage to "listserv@cornell.edu":SUBSCRIBE NUNTIUS-L your real nameorSUBSCRIBE NUNTIUS-ANNOUNCE-L your real namewhere "your real name"  is something like "Hans Jensen".Any questions about list subscriptions should be sent to theNuntius mailing list administrator, Aaron Freimark(aaron@med.cornell.edu).______________________________________________________________Know bugs in latest version of Nuntius      Nuntius can't find it's preferences file.      Workaround: run Nuntius on another mac, and copy the      "Nuntius private files" folder      (located in the preferences folder in the system folder)      to your mac.      This bug is sometimes easy to reproduce and sometimes not.      Sometimes the "Quit" menu item is grayed out. I would like      to get feedback on this, as I only have experienced it once      Hitting the space key several times in a row while displaying      the text of articles may freeze the mac.______________________________________________________________Bugs fixed and improvements.1.2 final.  Removed extra "TCHR" resource (backup of "Latin1/DK-ASCII")  Temporary preference files are now deleted.  Submenu of grouplist documents should not be empty anymore.  Save article uses NewsServer translate tables.1.1.4b2:  X-Date header is now 1994 instead of 94.  X-UserAgent changed to X-Newsreader.  Bug in (scan subject of) extracting binaries fixed.1.1.4b1  Thread Unit rewritten. Has now support for 3 implementations of threads:    1) Apple's Thread Manager extension    2) My own setjmp/longjmp implementation.    3) My own copy stacks into handle (the old  "d e v e l o p"  type).    #3 is always used on MacPlus, as they have a bug in the ResourceMgr        (Apples ThreadMgr are not compatible with MacPlus either).    #1 is used if present, otherwise #2  -  Better MacTCP code: issues read only when something *is* received.  Reduced number of segments -> should load a little faster, or just for fun.  Better handling of windows menu.  Faster (network) read of preferences files.  All windows are now edited in AdLib, making it easier for other    appls to read the 'View' format.  The new-user is now able to edit server-prefs before Nuntius tries to    do anything with the server.  NewOptions: authentication when openening a NNTP connection, and not    postponed until the server asks for it.  Able to close list of threads window, while extracting binaries.  Alert if cancelling while Nuntius is posting an article, as it may    be posted anyway. (No support in NNTP for aborting an operation).  Better mapping of chars in US/DK-ASCII tables (quotes, accents, etc).  If the specified translatetable is not available, Nuntius will just    post an alert without quitting.  ArticleWindow-update bug fixed.  NewFeature: ROT13 implemented.  NewOption: one can alter the rate at which Nuntius checks for new articles  If some of the saved articles is not available, Nuntius will tell you, and    save the available articles.  Appends UNIX mailbox "From" header in Notes files: can be browsed by Eudora.   Fix for crash if local prefs was denied by the "Eudora document Trick".  Warning if running an old pre-final version (I just got tired of getting    too many bug reports for old versions). Tells to upgrade.  Checks the Preferences folder for changes much more seldom. Better GUI    response when the folder is located at a server.  NewFeature: can start check for new articles manually.  NewFeature: assigns commandkeys 1-9 to items in the grouplist submenu.-  -  The code doing all the "post article/followup" windows has been reworked,    but should be rewritten from scratch. Until then, it may be unstable.1.1.3  "Talk with system adm" bug fixed.  New splash screen with the real version number (read from vers resource).1.1.2 final:      No more experimental.      Reworked some code to avoid freeze crashes.      It will not switch to ISO-2022 if you have only installed one script system.        (To avoid displaying some articles in Chicago).      All filemgr calls are now async and buffered:         (AppleShare users _will_ notice it)      Fixed bug in checking for blocking local prefs: if the preferences folder        contains an alias to the real "Nuntius personal files", Nuntius will not        abort anymore but silently resolve the alias.1.1.1d27:      *** Still experimental ***      Support for ISO-2022 indication, but does not remember the indication      across lines. Posted articles does always end in Roman state.      (For US/European people: is able to encode Katakana/Kanji, but not flawless).      You have to format the articles with newlines yourself, Nuntius doesn't      try do to anything like that at all when it uses this encoding,       it doesn't even look for spaces. The character set translate table is not       used when Nuntius detects articles posted with ISO-2022 (or posts itself).            Look in the Prefs/Editor menu for using ISO-2022 when posting.      Thanks to Shigeru Kanemoto for the ISO 2022 conversion code.      1.1.1d26:      Some low-level code for memory handling have been improved. Rebuild the      list of all groups is 5 times as fast on my mac. (no promise for your mac).      This version may be unstable as it is not tested much, so       *** please don't distribute it to the rest of the world ***      I'll let you know when I think I it's stable.      As I don't need the same bug reported by 400 people, only 40 :-)1.1.1d25:      Option for specifying max number of articles in group database.      !!! This should reduce the needed amount of memory needed !!!      Clicking outside text in grouplists, will deselect. (I listen, I listen)      Found & fixed bug causing "In TPeriodicThread::GoSleep, fThreadCmd was not gone".1.1.1d24:      Fixed charset translation in copy/reply etc. (double bug actually)1.1.1d23:      Rewrote code to close MacTCP connections if Nuntius is aborted (cmd-opt-esc),        or a fatal error occurs.      Added Transparent charset, look at Prefs/NewsServer.      Lookups the servers IP at launch. Performs basic tests if it changes.1.1.1d22:      Tried to fix "1 in list of USED TProgress", but have disabled the report        as the error doesn't matter.      When trying to display unavailable articles, their status are set to read.      If all text in an article is selected, it will be deselected if clicking      wihtout modifierkeys.1.1.1d21:      Fixed a bug in choosing files: didn't show anything resonable.      Fixed some bugs in the new uudecoder.1.1.1d20:      Fix for "TObjectCache::Free(), Has 1 object in list of USED TProgress"        - but untested as I can't reproduce it.      Kills MacTCP stuff in Nuntius heap if forced quit1.1.1d19:      If the shiftkey is down, Nuntius will not decode the BinHex        (just save it).       More classes is pointer based.1.1.1d18:      BinHex decoder implemented. Will decode the binhex, not just save      the text.      The same appl for extracting the saved BinHex is used for       the decoded binhex.      1.1.1d17:      Added new news server translate tables:        "Latin1/US-ASCII (In/Out)"   (default for new users)        "Latin1/DK-ASCII (In/Out)"   (for Danish users)      Translates subject & from headers too        balloon help in list of all groups too      Fixed bug in translate of 8 bits chars when posting article      Better at reporting fatal errors to me      Fixed "In TPeriodicThread::GoSleep, fThreadCmd was not gone"      Fixed "In TGroupListDoc::Free, had fPeriodicCheck"      1.1.1d16:      Fixed bug in finding database file for groups with long names (>29 chars)        this caused the mac to hang when Nuntius tried to open such a group        (bug introduced in d14, and did trash a lot of disks, sorry)      Fixed bug in errormessages.      Expires threads when all of the articles have been expired at the server.        - or no new articles have been added the last 3 days and the first          article have been expired at the server1.1.1d15:      Fixed bug in killing processes for periodic task like updating groups        (fixes "In TPeriodicThread::GoSleep, fThread was not killed")      Reserved more memory for low memory situations      Stops updating processes etc when in low memory situtation, but        user can still abort updating etc.      Fixed bug in disposing thread when it was not started        (eg not enough memory to create it). This caused some        "TThread::Free: 'this' is not gCurThread"      Fixed bug in asking for password (cleared local copy unless it was         stored in the prefs)1.1.1d14:      Generates TeachText with description of fatal bugs instead        of asking the user to take a snapshot. Reports available memory too now.      Fixed bug in killing processes when quitting Nuntius      Fixed bug in forking processes      Fixed bug in killing a process (showed up when killing >1 processes)      Quote char is in STR# (actually template)1.1.1d13:      Have written my own process manager (instead of using the        library from "d e v e l o p" #6). This should fix the        fatal errors "returned from EndThread(devThread)".      Recognizes "too many users" strings for nntp error 400      Expires threads only when the first article is not available at the        server, and no new articles have been added the last 3 days      Other fixes (lost this file due to bug in MPW script...)1.1.1d12      Max articles in XHDR command batches is preference        (utilize news server disk cache feature)      Reserves much more memory for threads: should avoid the fatal bug:        "In TThread::Free, returned from EndThread(devThread);"

bogous "ready" msg from ANU news server when your        mac has no dot name      Nuntius wont open 'PREF' files created by other appls.      Progress bar does not work too fast/much when updating
