Tetris Light
Version 1.0
5th August 1993

This is a light weight implementation of Tetris for the Macintosh.
I wrote it so that I can have a nice uncluttered game which does not
require colour or any other features (it has been developed and
tested on an SE).  The sources have been placed under the GNU General
Public License, so that if you want some feature, you can add it
yourself. See the ``Copying'' file for details.

Features:

- Minimal hardware requirements. Should run on all Macs back to the
  original 128K Mac (if you delete the 'snd ' resources using ResEdit,
  the program will then use the system beep instead).
  
- Available under GNU General Public License with Think C 5.0 sources.

- Saving and restoring of games.

- Correct spelling of `Light'.
