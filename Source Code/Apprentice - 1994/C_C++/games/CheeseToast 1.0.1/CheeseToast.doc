CheeseToast is a Maelstrom/Asteroids-inspired game I wrote to teach myself
how to do sprite-movement on the Macintosh.  I hope you like it.  Feel free to 
replace the sprites and/or sounds.  

This archive contains the (uncommented, undocumented) Think C source code 
as an aid to Programmers who are interested in such things.

To run the game, you only need the application "Cheese Toast" and the file "CT Resources".

CheeseToast requires a color mac with a 12" monitor or larger and 32-bit Quickdraw.

CheeseToast is free.  The reason CheeseToast is free is because I don't have 
time to a) Polish It  and b) Handle technical support or programming questions.
Please don't include CheeseToast or it's source code in Shareware collections
that cost money without receiving my permission.

If you would like to do a major revision of CheeseToast, let me know!  I'd be especially
interested in seeing some bolo-like extensions.  heh heh.

Changes for version 1.0.1:

Cheese Toast now runs correctly on 12 inch monitors, and it centers properly
on monitors larger than 13 inches.

I also fixed an opening audio glitch that was happening on machines with
Sound Mgr 3.0.

Sprite movement has been sped up a bit.
