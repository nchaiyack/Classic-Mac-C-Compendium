This is the first version of GNU Chess for the Mac. It is based on version 3.00 of GNU Chess. It is NOT an official release brought to you by contributors in the GNU community, since GNU boycott Apple. 

The official distribution (for other computers) can be obtained on Internet from:
	prep.ai.mit.edu:/u2/emacs/gnuchess-3.00.tar.Z
	
(please be patient as the file will appear at this location.)

Read the file “Copying” in the directory “Documentation” for more details.

The source files are not very clean: very Mac and compiler dependent, no comments, variables and functions names do not follow any convention.  Some more readable sources will be available with future versions of GNU Chess for the Mac.
