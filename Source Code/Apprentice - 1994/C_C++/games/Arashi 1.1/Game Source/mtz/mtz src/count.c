/* This routine sums the scores fro the LEVL rsrc included in the ARS.rsrc file *//* Simply put, there is only a probability of how many points a player might score *//* How many Spikers, and Plasma shots will be scored by the player is perhaps *//* the largest variable.  Also, the player does not receive points for enemies *//* onEdge at Flythru.  Further at higher levels, the player may tend to one spot *//* and will not hit more Spikers even if more are appearing.  This is all only *//* a guess, legitimized by scores from sample games. *//* This routine will also store the new lvStBonus scores in the LEVEL resource which *//* can then be pasted into a new ARASHI file. *//* December 16, 1992  Mike Zimmerman */#include "STORM.h"#include <stdio.h>#define probOfHittingSpkr 0.40#define	predNumber	20main(){	LevelInfo	**LInfo;	int			i;	long		int levelbonus=0;	long		int totalbonus=0;	FILE		*fp;	int			predNumSpkrs=0;	long		int	oldBonus=0;		/* fp=fopen("scores","w"); */		for(i=1;i <= 96 ;i++)	{	LInfo=(void *)GetResource('LEVL',(127+i));	HNoPurge(LInfo);	/* fprintf(fp,"LEVEL %d \n",i); */#ifdef BONUSGEN	predNumSpkrs=0;	if ((*LInfo)->spProb)		predNumSpkrs = (int)((i * .45));	if (predNumSpkrs > 12)		predNumSpkrs = 12 + (int)(i * .08);	/* fprintf(fp,"spProb was %d \n",(*LInfo)->spProb);	fprintf(fp,"Predicted number of Spikers %d \n",predNumSpkrs); */	levelbonus =  (long)(*LInfo)->flPoints*(*LInfo)->flCount + 			(long)(*LInfo)->puPoints*(*LInfo)->puCount + 			(long)(*LInfo)->fuBullseye*(*LInfo)->fuCount + 			(long)(300 + ((*LInfo)->tk[0].points) )*(*LInfo)->tk[0].count + 			(long)(1000 + ((*LInfo)->tk[1].points) )*(*LInfo)->tk[1].count + 			(long)(400 + ((*LInfo)->tk[2].points) )*(*LInfo)->tk[2].count +			(long)(*LInfo)->lvBonus +			(long)( (*LInfo)->spPoints * predNumSpkrs) +			(long)( (*LInfo)->spPlPoints * predNumSpkrs * (*LInfo)->spPlasma * .35);		/* fprintf(fp,"%d Flippers at %d points each = %ld \n",(*LInfo)->flCount,		(*LInfo)->flPoints,	(long)(*LInfo)->flPoints*(*LInfo)->flCount);	fprintf(fp,"%d Pulsars at %d points each = %ld \n",(*LInfo)->puCount,		(*LInfo)->puPoints,(long)(*LInfo)->puPoints*(*LInfo)->puCount);	fprintf(fp,"%d Fireballs at %d points each = %ld \n",(*LInfo)->fuCount,		(*LInfo)->fuBullseye,(long)(*LInfo)->fuBullseye*(*LInfo)->fuCount);	fprintf(fp,"%d fltankers at %d points each = %ld \n",(*LInfo)->tk[0].count,		(*LInfo)->tk[0].points,(long)(300+(*LInfo)->tk[0].points)*(*LInfo)->tk[0].count);	fprintf(fp,"%d putankers at %d points each = %ld \n",(*LInfo)->tk[1].count,		(*LInfo)->tk[1].points,(long)(400+(*LInfo)->tk[1].points)*(*LInfo)->tk[1].count);	fprintf(fp,"%d futankers at %d points each = %ld \n",(*LInfo)->tk[2].count,		(*LInfo)->tk[2].points,(long)(400+(*LInfo)->tk[2].points)*(*LInfo)->tk[2].count);	fprintf(fp,"Predicted point for Spikers = %ld \n",		(long)( (*LInfo)->spPoints * predNumSpkrs));	fprintf(fp,"Predicted points for Plasma = %ld \n",		(long)( (*LInfo)->spPlPoints * predNumSpkrs * (*LInfo)->spPlasma * .35));	fprintf(fp,"So the total for level %d is %ld \n",i,levelbonus); */		(*LInfo)->lvStBonus = oldBonus;#endif	(*LInfo)->shPower = 5;	ChangedResource(LInfo);	WriteResource(LInfo);	HPurge(LInfo);#ifdef BONUSGEN		ReleaseResource(LInfo);	totalbonus += levelbonus;	oldBonus = (long)(1.10*totalbonus);	oldBonus = oldBonus/10;	oldBonus = oldBonus*10;	/* fprintf(fp,"Total going into level %d is %ld \n", i+1, totalbonus); */	/*	fprintf(fp,"So the starting bonus for level %d is %ld \n",(i+1),(long)(totalbonus*.95));	fprintf(fp,"=========================== \n");#endif	}#ifdef BONUSGEN	fclose(fp); */#endif	}}
