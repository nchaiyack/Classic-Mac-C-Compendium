The source code in this archive works with Think C 5.04. Support for Think C 6.0 is planned and should be a matter of adding a few prototypes or turning off some compilation flags. If you do this before September 1993, please report your findings to jmunkki@hut.fi. After that, I will probably have converted all my programs for  the new compiler (hopefully they get the bugs out by that time).

Sincerely,

           Juri Munkki
