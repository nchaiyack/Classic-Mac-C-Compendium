ARASHI Manual.--------------This is a very small overview of the game and options.  It is no great piece ofliterature, but hopefully explains the basics of the game. Please do read itthrough entirely.  Some options should probably be cross-referenced betterand/or have their own section, but overall the manual is short, so please read itto be sure you understand all of the options.  Again, in reference to version 1.0,all of the reported bugs were fixed (or in one case mostly fixed...was a cosmeticbug on multiple monitors) and *if it seems different than in 1.0*, it probably is.=======General=======The object of ARASHI is to score points and advance levels.  You advance levels by killing all of the enemies.  'You' are the crawler.  You move around the top edgeof a tube, or sheet.  The player may move by use of the mouse or by use of the keyboard.Keys may be defined by pressing the p or P key for Pause during a game.  For mouse use, the button shoots, and the space bar is superzap.Currently (barring any unforeseen changes) there are 96 unique levels.  There are16 level shapes and 6 level colors.  After clearing level 96, play continues on the Doomsday levels which are described later.=======Enemies=======There are several types of enemies:Flippers, Pulsars, Fuseballs, Spikers, Tankers.  Flippers are your only enemy on the first level.  They rotate up at you.  If they land flat across you, they capture you and you lose a life.  You may rotate under them while they are changing lanes.Pulsars start appearing on the red levels.  They also rotate around like flippers, but after they move into a lane, they also 'pulse' which renders the lane deadly.  The end segment of a lane will disappear when a pulsar is pulsing.  There is a small delay aftera pulsar moves into a lane before it begins to pulse.Fuseballs start in the late blue levels.  They float between lanes much of the time and cannot be shot.  They also move up and down, and may come up to the edge of thelanes where the player moves.  The crawler can only move through a Fuseball that ison the edge when the Fuseball is on a lane junction.  Even then, this is not easy.Shooting fuseballs at different distances will reward different point values.  This value may optionally be displayed above the destroyed Fuseball by checking the Show Fuseball Scores box on the startup game options page.Tankers carry 2 of either Flippers, Pulsars, or Fuseballs.  Tankers for each will havedifferent colors.  Shooting a Tanker releases the two other enemies it is carrying.Spikers lay spikes.  All Spikers do not have to be killed.  Spikers are the only enemythat shoots at the crawler.  Spikes laid by the Spiker must be avoided in the warp fromone level to the next.=======Bonuses=======The player receives a small, but increasing bonus as a level is cleared.  This bonus is received after the player has successfully navigated the warp to the next level.A starting bonus is also received is the player starts on a level higher than level 1.This starting bonus is displayed above the level during the Level Selection.==========Free Lives==========A free life is earned every 20,000 pts.  There is a mximum limit of 5 extra livesat any one time (plus the active life is really 6).  This does not mean that you canonly earn 5 free lives, this means that there may be some multiple of 20,000 which you will pass without receiving a free life because you already have the maximum limit.  Also only one free life may be earned from the starting bonus.  The flash and sound will not occur if a free life is earned as a result of the starting bonus.=========SuperZaps=========A player receives two superzaps per level. The second superzap only hits one thing. The order of selection goes Fuseball, Pulsar, Flipper, Tanker.============Play Options============Arcade mode lets the player restart *close* to the last completed level.  This level will be less than 95.  The gaps of legal restart levels become larger as the level numbers get higher, so restarting a game at a higher level may put you back several levels.  The player may restart at the highest *restart* level on the list which is at or below the highest level *completed* in the last game.  RestartingARASHI will reset this to level 9.Practice mode lets you start at any legal restart level up to 95 (there are 96 levels).  The count of enemies left, and the count of enemies on edge is displayed in the upper right corner.Separate High score lists are saved for each play mode.In both play modes, the "high score to beat" is displayed in the upper right corneralong with the initials of the person who scored it.  The score shown is the next highest score (above your current score) on the high score list for your play mode.  ============Saving games============One game for each play mode (Arcade and Practice) may be saved by using the Pause dialog.  If you save a game during the warp to the next level, you will have to repeat the level.  You must get TO a level before your game can be saved there.=============Loading Games=============This saved game may be reloaded during the Level Select section of starting a new game.  The saved game will appear as the first level, and will be in purple.  The bonus shown above the saved game is the score from that game.Play resumes at the start of the saved level.  Score and lives are saved. If the saved game is on a Doomsday level, the number of superzaps is also saved.  Also sincethe Doomsday levels are random, you may re-start on a different shape, butit will be the same level number.===============Doomsday Levels===============After level 96, green levels are selected at random.  However, if a player dies on a Doomsday level, play does not resume on that level shape.  Instead play resumes on anew random Doomsday level.  The number of enemies also resets at this point.  In addition, the player's superzap is not recharged until the player completes a level and flies on to another level.===========Script File===========Arashi now defaults to run from the Arashi Script file which should be in the same folder as Arashi. This script can be altered, if you wish, to suit your taste.Default scripts are contained within the Arashi application.============Distribution============ARASHI may be freely distributed as long as:a) all documents included in this archive are includedb) it is not for profitAlso I would like to add that the changes from STORM 0.9B1 to ARASHI 1.x were ONLYmade because the code was made freely available by Juri .  I would like to encourage other Mac programmers to make as much of their code available via on-line services, etc, as possible.  Programming the Mac is not that bad, but code examples sure go a long way in helping new people along (in my opinion).  Thanks :-)Hope you enjoy it,Mike================Programmers Note================ARASHI disables Superclock by installing a dummy GESTALT selector 'SAVR' with areturn value of 0x12.  This value causes Superclock to think a screen saver isactive, thus Superclock will not draw to the screen.  To insure smooth installationand removal of this selector (some screen savers might use it) ARASHI also installsits own GESTALT selector, 'ASHI'.  ASHI will return 0x01 ARASHI is loaded, and 0x00 when not.  ARASHI limits itself to one active copy to prevent endless nestingof pointer to old GESTALT functions.  One active copy should not be a limitationto most people :-)
