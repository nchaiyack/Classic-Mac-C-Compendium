terrain.

@b{independent unit}: A unit that does not belong to any side.

@b{interface}: The software that manages interaction between a player
and the kernel.

@b{naming method}: An algorithm for generating names.

@b{occupant}: A unit that is contained in another unit.  See transport.

@b{pattern}: A special kind of image that can be repeated many times in
a regular fashion.  Usually used to display terrain.

@b{people}: Special ``material types'' that are actually considered
to represent individuals.

@b{plan}: The information that a unit uses to decide what to do next.

@b{player}: A participant in a game.  Can be a human or a computer.

@b{production}: The process by which units and terrain make materials
appear.

@b{region}: A set of cells in the world.  It can be any size or shape.

@b{savefile}: A special game module that contains an exact replica of a game
in progress.

@b{scorekeeper}: An object that manages (part of) the standings of players
in a game, and also handles recording of final scores.

@b{self-unit}: A unit that represents the whole side.

@b{side}: The representation of a single player within the game.
