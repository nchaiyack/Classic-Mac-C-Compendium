ImFam is a utility for examining and converting the image families used by Xconq.The general concept of image families is similar to the Finder icon families, where several depths and sizes of an icon are available for use in different situations.  Xconq adds extra complexity to the concept by including tiling patterns and using families on several different platforms.The platform-independent format is not very efficient to use and would be hard to edit, so ImFam provides tools to convert between the common format and Mac resources.These tools are available from the File Menu.In addition, ImFam also allows you to look at the images.  You can control the images' size, overlay, and use of color.  The primary use for this is to test how an image works in various situations.  Also, if you design games, this is a good place to start when choosing images for your game.  Since there are several hundred images available already, the chances are good that the desired images have already been designed.
