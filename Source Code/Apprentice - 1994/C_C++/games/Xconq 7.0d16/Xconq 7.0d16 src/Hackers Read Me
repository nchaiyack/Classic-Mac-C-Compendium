This is info about hacking on Macintosh Xconq.Building Xconq under Think C (5.0.2 or later):Sorry, but 4M RAM under System 7 is not enough to compile all the files - Think C runs out of memory for what appears to be obscure reasons.  8M RAM is enough to build, run, and debug Xconq, plus have ResEdit open as well.Building Xconq under MPW:Has been started, but not finished yet, plus compile options need tweaking still.Skelconq:Skelconq is a game testing and compilation application that uses console I/O only.ImFam:ImFam is a utility for examining and converting the image families used by Xconq.Files and Folders:Generic sources are in "src", Mac-specific code in "mac".  Xconq uses all files in "mac" and "src" except for "skelconq.c", "unix.c", "cmdline.c", and "compile.c", while Skelconq uses everything except "unix.c" and nothing in "mac".Generic test cases and machinery are in "test".Documentation in TeX (texinfo) is in "doc".Sources to the other Xconq interfaces are in "Other".  These are sometimes useful for reference.  There is also other random stuff that we don't want in the main folder.Note that "src", "lib", "test", and "doc" are identical on all systems, so don't put anything in them that can't be included everywhere.  (No binaries for instance.)
