This is the version of TE32K that I use.  Ask around and you'll findthat lots of other people have added significant modifications andimprovements, which most of them are kind enough to share.  I reallyneed to collect all these modifications and release an updated versionof this thing someday, though with WASTE out now, that seems kind ofpointless.BTW, WASTE is a > 32K text editing engine that supports styled text.It should be available for FTP'ing at sumex, etc.-Roy Wood (rrwood@io.org)
