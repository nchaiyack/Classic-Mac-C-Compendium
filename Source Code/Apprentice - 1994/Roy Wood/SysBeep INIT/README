This is the source code for an INIT that randomizes the system
beeps (as produced by calls to _SysBeep).


Build the SysBeep.¹ project first; it's code will be used as the
resources included when you next build INIT.¹.  The final output
of this domino-effect build (output of previous build becomes
resource code used in next project) is the usable INIT.

Enjoy.
