The source code in this folder is for my System Folder Lock, which
runs only under system 6 or earlier.  The idea is that this patch
hooks into GetCatInfo, and fudges things so that the system folder
is truly absent from the list of items returned by standard and
non-standard "Get File" dialogs, etc.

To build the complete project, compile things in the following order:

PBGetCatInfo.¹   -----> INIT.¹.Rsrc
INIT.¹           -----> Sysfolder Lock.¹.Rsrc
Sysfolder Lock.¹ -----> SysFolder Lock


The code for each project is saved as resource data that Think C
automatically includes when the next project is built (note the
clever choice of output file names....).

As always, questions go to rrwood@io.org.
