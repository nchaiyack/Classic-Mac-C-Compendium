Here's the source for a distributed Mandelbrot generator.  It usesAppleTalk to locate other copies of the app running on the network,then instructs each copy to generate a separate part of the Mandelbrotset, and finally reconstructs the complete image from the pieces.The app starts up in slave mode, so you have to select one machine tobe the master and take it from there.-Roy Wood (rrwood@io.org)
