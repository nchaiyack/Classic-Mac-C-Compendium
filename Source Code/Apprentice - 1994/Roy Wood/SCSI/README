This is the source code to a SCSI HD formatter, sort of.

Well, the story goes that I bought this old Seagate ST225N and it
wouldn't format with the Apple HD Setup programs (even the hacked
ones that were supposed to work with all manufacturer's drives).

Some experimenting showed that the drive really was formatting fine,
except for the LAST block on the disk, which was somehow write-
protected (probably from the days when everyone had proprietary
drivers, etc., and manufacturers hid secret id codes in places
like the last block of the drive).  This was a real pain, so
I finally hit upon the solution of just copying the first 256
blocks from my internal HD to the Seagate, effectively creating
a working partitioned drive, which runs fine now (a little more
tinkering was necessary, and the drive had to be erased by the
Finder/MacOS before being used).

There is a lot of junk in here, but it may be useful to someone
else.....
