This is the source to my Control Panel Lock, which works only under
system 6 or earlier.

The idea is that you install the INIT/CDEV in your system folder,
and then once it's loaded, the user cannot get into the control
panel unless he/she holds down the option and command keys while
selecting "Control Panel" from the Apple menu, and then entering
the correct password.  Obviously this is only a useful thing to
do on a machine that is subject to use by semi-malicious dummies.

To build the complete package, build the "OpenDeskAcc.¹" project
first; the code that results (and the resources in the 
"OpenDeskAcc.¹.Rsrc" file) will be saved as "INIT.¹.Rsrc".  Next,
build the INIT.¹ project, the results of which will be saved
as "CPanel Lock.¹.Rsrc".  And finally, build the "CPanel Lock.¹"
project to create the usable CDEV.

Hope this helps.  The code is not commented, but I welcome questions
at rrwood@io.org.
