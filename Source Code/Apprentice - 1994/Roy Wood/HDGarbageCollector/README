This is the source code for my Garbage Collector application.

The idea was that this thing would be used to create a master image
of what a hard drive should contain, and then the user would periodically
run it to clean up junk that gets put on it by dumb users.  It is
a useful thing for a public lab or some similar setup....

It needs to be cleaned up a lot, and I don't have the time or desire....
