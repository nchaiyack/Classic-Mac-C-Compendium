TSMHelper - a aid for hacks by Donald Brown

WHAT IS IT
While pLayer and AppBar can run without patching any traps, GNEFilter is not as robust as it should be, nor is there a good way for multiple apps using GNEFilter to arbitrate themselves.  This INIT, which both pLayer and AppBar can take advantage of, increases the robustness and makes things clean.

REQUIREMENTS
pLayer requires System 7.1.  If you don't have System 7.1, you'll get a crash.

HOW TO USE IT

Just put it in your system folder and reboot.  pLayer and AppBar will find it automatically.

LIMITS/BUGS/IDEAS FOR ENHANCEMENT

These are thoughts I've had about possible changes to pLayer.  They may, or may not, be changed in the future.

(1)  We're still not perfect on getting all clicks, though we are better than without TSMHelper.
