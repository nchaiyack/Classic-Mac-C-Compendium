DropShell provides a complete framework for the creation of 'DropBoxes'
for System 7, thanks to Finder7's "Drag & Drop" capabilities.  

Unlike other DropBox examples, DropShell uses the CORRECT System 7 method
for handling Dropboxes - Apple events!  DropShell handles all four of the
required events and in turns passes the information contained therein to 
your 'userProcs' which do the gory details of your dropbox.  

DropShell is also one of the first fully factored applications - meaning that
any DropShell based application can be 'recorded' using an Apple event recorder,
since it sends events to itself when appropriate.  It also includes a correct
'aete' resource for interaction with scripting systems.

DropShell handles a simple user interface including a splash screen, 
a "Select File…" option and COMPLETE balloon help for all menus & dialogs.

Versions are provided for MPW C & Pascal as well Think C & Pascal.  We hope
to provide versions in the future built around an OO framework in C++, Think C
w/Objects & Object Pascal.  

For those simply interested in quickly putting together their own dropboxes, 
check out DSUserProcs (.c or .p) for information about where your code goes.  
You should also check out DropShell.r, even if you are not using MPW, as all 
the resources are documented with comments about their use and which need to 
change for your individual dropbox.

The source is well commented as to how the DropShell is organized for the
curious and contains some very useful programming techniques and reusable source code.

Also included a bunch of utility routines (DSUtils) that you may find useful. 
They are some useful things you may wish to do with the Process Manager, and
the Apple event Manager including sending events to yourself or finding out
where you are and what you name is.  

We have also provided an example DropBox - DropInfo.  DropInfo provides a function
formally left to programs like DiskTop or ResEdit, that of viewing and editing a
files type & creator as well as the 'Finder Flags'.  It is useful not only as 
an example DropBox, but also as useful code samples for playing with the Finder
Flags (especially how to get the Finder to immediately update!)

If you create any nifty DropBoxes using DropShell, we would appreciate it if you
sent us copies so we can see how DropShell is being used.  Also, if you port
DropShell to other development environments (Fortran, Modula-2, etc.), please 
send us a copy so that we can keep an up to date set of sources.

If you have any questions, suggestions, bug reports or improvements for DropShell,
please feel free to send them to either of us (both is even better ;-).

Special thanks to those who played with the early versions of the DropBoxes, 
(you know who you are!) and especially those who reviewed this code & offered 
suggestions for it's improvement for distribution (Marshall Clow, Greg Robbins & Dave Koziol)
