Name: CScrolloramaVersion: 1.1Category: classesContributor: Jamie McCarthy <k044477@kzoo.edu>Date: 92-11TCL-Version: 1.1.xTCL-Language: CCopyright: Copyright (C) 1992 by Jamie R. McCarthy. All rights reserved.A CScrollorama is a subclass of CPanorama with four features.(1) Scroll() doesn't call _ScrollRect, so there's no erasure flash;(2) scrolling is restricted within a margin.  (3) Marten Sorliden'sSetBounds() bug fix;  and (4) avoidance (very useful, but toocomplex to explain briefly). This newer version fixes one logic bug and one inefficiency. (c) Copyright 1992 by Jamie R.
