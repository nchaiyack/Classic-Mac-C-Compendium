/* * CSelfCancelableChore.c * * A chore that can cancel itself. * * Chores that subclass off of this class, instead of CChore, have * one extra privilege and one extra responsibility.  The privilege * is that they can call cancelSelf()--they don't have to be canceled * from an outside source.  The responsibility is that they must * check reallyPerform() at the start of every Perform() method, and * immediately return without doing anything if it's FALSE. * * © Copyright 1992 by Jamie R.
