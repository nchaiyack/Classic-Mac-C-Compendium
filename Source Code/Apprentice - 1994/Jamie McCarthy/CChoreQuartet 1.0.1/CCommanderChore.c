/* * CCommanderChore.c * * A chore that sends a command. * * There are three ways to send the command:  once with an urgent * chore, once with an idle chore, or continuously with an idle * chore.  I advise using the functions doCommandViaUrgentChore(), * doCommandViaIdleChore(), and doCommandContinuouslyViaIdleChore(); * they'll do all the setting-up for you.  The latter returns the * chore in question, so that if you want to cancel it later, * you can.  The former two cancel themselves, so you don't need * to worry about them. * * © Copyright 1992-93 by Jamie R. McCarthy.
