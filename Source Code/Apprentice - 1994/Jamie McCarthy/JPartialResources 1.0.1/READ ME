Name: JPartialResourcesVersion: 1.0.1Category: functionsContributor: Jamie McCarthy <k044477@kzoo.edu>Date: 93-10-20TCL-Version: 1.1.2TCL-Language: CCopyright: Copyright (C) 1992-93 by Jamie R. McCarthy. All rights reserved.This archive contains the .c and .h files for JPartialResources 1.0.1.The code extends the partial-resource calls into system 6--and yes itdoes read in only the section requested, not the whole resource.CFlexiDataFile uses JPartialResources;  if you're using that class,this new version just drops right in.1.0.1 is a little better about error-handling--it sets ResErr instead ofdropping into the debugger--and it is a little more fastidious aboutusing Gestalt, though it probably won't ever make any difference.But the main new feature is that it doesn't go to disk twice when onceis enough.  Marco Piovanelli was kind enough to point out that some ofthe information I needed is resident in RAM.  So this version should bequite a bit faster than 1.0, especially if you're making many accessesto small amounts of data.This code shipped in our latest game, which depends on it quiteheavily.  So I'd give it very high reliability marks.It's freeware--if you like it, drop me a line.
