Speedy Mouse ][ is a very small INIT which will cause your mouse to move about twice as fast as it normally does.  Just throw the INIT in your system folder and restart.  (If there is a problem at startup time, Speedy Mouse ][ will beep once.  The only reason this would happen is if the 'mcky' resources in your System file are corrupted.  If this is the case, you should probably re-install your system.)While Speedy Mouse ][ is installed, you can temporarily get the mouse back to normal speed by putting the caps lock on.This is the sequel to Speedy Mouse, which had many incompatibilities with extensions like Snap-To, Quickeys, and voice-navigation software which moves the cursor for the user.  Speedy Mouse ][ should work with all such software.  The original Speedy Mouse made it impossible to move the cursor 1 pixel at a time; it moved 2 pixels even with the slightest mouse movement.  Speedy Mouse ][ fixes this problem.  The original Speedy Mouse did not work properly on systems with multiple monitors.  Speedy Mouse ][ fixes this problem, too.CAVEAT: Do not edit the 'mcky' resources in the current System file while Speedy Mouse ][ is installed.  (Trust me when I tell you that you don’t want to know the consequences of editing them.)  This shouldn’t be too much of a burden, since you shouldn’t be editing the current System file anyway.COPYRIGHT NOTICES:Speedy Mouse ][ 1.0 is copyright ©1994 Mark Pilgrim.
