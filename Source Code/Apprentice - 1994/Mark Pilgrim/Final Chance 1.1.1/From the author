Final Chance is a combination of fluff and utility.  On one hand, it gives you a quote on shutdown which is completely unrelated to anything else you might have been working on.  On the other hand, it does give you a final chance to change your mind about shutting down your Macintosh.  I find it useful, since I have open-apple-S as the key equivalent for “Shut Down” in the Finder, and about once a week I will go to save something and end up shutting down instead, because I switched to the Finder and didn’t notice until it was too late.  (I know, I could just change the key equivalent, but that wouldn’t solve the larger problem, now, would it?  “What larger problem?” I hear you cry.  Stop obscuring my argument with logic...)

Version 1.1.1 adds 50 more quotes to the collection, for a total of 150.  You can add or remove quotes by editing the STR# 128 resource.  Add as many as you like; Final Chance will select one at random from however many are there.

You can bypass the dialog box (and shut down immediately) by holding down the option key when you select “Shut Down” (or, in my case, press open-apple-S).  A new feature in version 1.1.1: if you let the dialog box sit there for 60 seconds, it will automagically choose the “Shut down” button for you, and your Mac will continue with the shutdown process.  (I added this feature in version 1.1, but I found out several hours after releasing it that it didn’t work properly.  Hopefully, version 1.1.1 holds up longer than a few hours.)

Anyway, I hope you enjoy it.  You might as well.
