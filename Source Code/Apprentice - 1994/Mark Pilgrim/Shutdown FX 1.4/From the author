Shutdown FX is a fun little INIT which will clear your screen with a cool graphic effect whenever you restart or shut down your Macintosh.  Just throw the INIT in your system folder and restart.  This INIT should work under all systems, with all monitors, on all Macintoshes.  If it doesn’t work on yours, let me know (see addresses below).

The first time you restart or shut down when Shutdown FX is running, an options dialog box will appear.  You may choose whether you want a graphic effect on restart, on shutdown, or both, and whether you want to cycle through the effects in sequence or always pick one at random.

After the first time, the options dialog will not appear automatically, but you can force it to appear by holding down the “option” key when you restart or shut down your Mac.

Changes in version 1.4:
- added 28 new graphic effects, for a total of 44
- added options dialog
- added option to have a graphic effect on restart
- added option to cycle through graphic effects in sequence
