Notes to fellow programmers:

• All the code in this archive is distributed under the GNU General Public License.  That means that you can take this program, update it, fix it, add to it, make it more robust, add features, add bells and whistles — and then you can rerelease it under the GNU General Public License.  The original code is still copyrighted to me, your additions are copyrighted to you, and the next person has the same chance that you did to learn from it.

• This program contains a self-integrity checker.  While you are testing and developing with this program, you should probably disable it.  (Comment out the DoIntegrityCheck() line in msg main.c.)  If and when you rerelease the program, please put the integrity check back in!  Such a simple procedure as checking the resource fork and map lengths to stored values can help early detection of viruses, and ensures a minimal amount of program integrity.

• To set up the integrity checker, you need an external program called “Prepare.”  In system 7, drag-and-drop the application onto “Prepare” and it will do the necessary work and quit peacefully.  Under system 6, open “Prepare” and choose “Open...” from the File menu, and select the application you are preparing.  The “necessary work” is merely storing the application’s resource fork and map lengths in the application’s resource fork.  When the application runs its self-integrity check, it merely checks the resource fork and map lengths and compares them with the stored values — so it’s important that you store the values before you run the application!

• I hope you enjoy this code and learn from it.  I did.
