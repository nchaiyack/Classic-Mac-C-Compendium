/**********************************************************************\File:		a4 setup.hPurpose:	This is an alternate header file instead of using "SetUpA4.h"			since that causes some technical problems in certain			circumstances.  The problems are solved by using this			shortened version and putting __GetA4() in the initialization			.c file instead.			Note:		This file was not written by the authors of Darth Fader			and is not subject to the terms of the GNU General Public			License.Darth Fader -=- fade in and out on system beepCopyright (C) 1993 Mark PilgrimThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modifyit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or(at your option) any later version.This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty ofMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
