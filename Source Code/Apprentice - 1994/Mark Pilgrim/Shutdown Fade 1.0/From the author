Shutdown Fade will cause your Macintosh to fade all attached screens to blackevery time it shuts down.  Just throw the INIT in your system folder and restart.  This INIT will only work on monitors with gamma -- the Mac II line, and any color Mac with a non-built-in monitor.  (It has not been tested on a Color Classic; if anyone has one and feels like testing, please let me know if it works.)COPYRIGHT NOTICES:Shutdown Fade 1.0 is copyright ©1993 Mark Pilgrim.
