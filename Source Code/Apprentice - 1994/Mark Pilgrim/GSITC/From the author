Go Sit In The Corner is a control panel which will make your mouse jump to a corner of the screen after a certain amount of time.  To install it, simply open the control panel, configure it to your liking, and close the control panel.  GSITC will begin to work as soon as you close the control panel.  Or, if you want GSITC to run every time you start your Mac, copy it to your system folder and restart.  (Under system 7, allow the system to move it to the Control Panels folder in the system folder.)You can set several options in the GSITC control panel: which corner the mouse jumps to, how long before it jumps, and whether it only jumps after a period of no mouse movement.  GSITC will not activate while the control panel is open; it will take effect as soon as you close the control panel (or, under system 6, as soon as you switch to a different control panel).A quasi-bug: the mouse will only jump to the corners of the main screen; if you have multiple monitors and change their relative positions while GSITC is running, the mouse may jump to the wrong place.  You will have to open and close the control panel for GSITC to notice the changed monitor setup.  (It will also notice it once you restart.)COPYRIGHT NOTICES:Go Sit In The Corner 1.0 is copyright ©1994, Mark Pilgrim.
