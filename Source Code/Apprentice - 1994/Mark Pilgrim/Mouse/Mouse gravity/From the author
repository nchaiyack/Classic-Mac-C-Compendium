Gravity Mouse is a fun little INIT which will cause your mouse to be occasionally overcome by gravity.  Just throw the INIT in your system folder and restart.  This INIT should work under all systems, with all monitors, on all Macintoshes.  If it doesn’t work on yours, let me know (see addresses below).  Note that I take no responsibility for any trouble you get in through improper use of this INIT.  Tampering with other people's computers is a crime in some states.  This is intended for use on your own computer only.COPYRIGHT NOTICES:Gravity Mouse 1.1 is copyright ©1993 Mark Pilgrim.
