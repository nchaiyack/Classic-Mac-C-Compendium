This directory contains a control definition (CDEF) thatimplements a basic dial control.  The user is able to clickto the left and right of the needle to move it, or click directlyon the needle to position it.The dial control's current value is displayed at the bottom ofthe control.I had problems getting this code to work.  Some of the things documentedin older IM's is incorrect concerning controls, and some of the newdocumentation did not help (later IMs of I-VI).This code is freely hackable -- do whatever you want with it.Brent Burtonbrentb@math.tamu.edu
