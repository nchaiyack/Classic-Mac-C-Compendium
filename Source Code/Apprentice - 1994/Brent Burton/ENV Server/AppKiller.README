Readme File for Application Killer 1.x.

Application Killer (AppKiller, AK, etc) is a small application I wrote to
stop other Apple Event-aware applications.  With AK, you can stop any
cooperating application easily.

Source code is available in a separate distribution, usually called
something like "AppKiller-1.2.cpt.hqx" at finer ftp sites near you.
Or not.
