			InvertShapes - an AfterDarkª screensaver module

	This module inverts sections of your screen until the whole thing is a very hashed mess.  There is an option to dim the screen while the module runs to a user-defined amount . A pop-up menu allows the user to control the shapes that invert the screen.
Also, a checkbox allows the user to blank the screen to black before the module starts running.  It works on all screensfor those lucky enough to have multiple monitors.

 This option is only available on those Macintoshes whose monitors can dim.


	It is small, simple, free - and include source code!
