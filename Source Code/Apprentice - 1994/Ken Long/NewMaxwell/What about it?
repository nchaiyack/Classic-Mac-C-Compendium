A note from Ken Long:

NewMaxwell is just a combination of Bullseye - as a shell - and
the source code in the "Original Maxwell" folder.  I use Bullseye
as a shell for all sorts of simple routines, to test them with.

Maxwell was a DA.  DA's are obsolete, with a hierarchiel Apple Menu.
I don't like them, like I did on my old Mac 512.  System 7 negates
the need for "Desk Accessories" - (my opinion).

I only got this to run in the shell - I DID NOT DEBUG IT.  I noticed
it seems to run okay in Think C, but the built application does not
work right.  Oh well (or is that "0L")?  YOU fix it!  I did most of
the update work!

But it IS an interesting code.  One more way of doing "sprites" - circa
1988 - the upload date to ftp oak.oakland.edu, where I got the source.

I like getting these old programs and seeing if I can get them to run.

ftp oak.oakland.edu has lots of old source code - some of which I got
running and redistributed a long time ago.

Since this is a semi-fossilized source project (like me) I don't expect
it to be of much use to anyone but source code junkies (like me) and
newcomers to Mac Think C.

Enjoy!
