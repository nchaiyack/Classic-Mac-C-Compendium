This is the Maxwell desk accessory.  It is written in version 2.? ofMegamax C.  This is public domain.To compile this, stick it on your Mac, and compile all the .c files.Link the resulting objects, with damain.o being first.  Make sure totell the linker that you are makeing a DRVR, not CODE.Note that these files were edited with tabstops set every four.Here is a suggestion for decreasing the turnaround timeif you are going to make changes to this:	1. Modify some random program that supports DAs to open	a resource file named TESTDA before it puts up the Apple	menu.  The editor demo program from Megamax is a good	choice.  Just change the place where it tries to open	"clock" to open "TESTDA" instead.	2. Have the linker put the DA in TESTDA.  Be sure to use	the same resource ID each time, or things might get	confused.	3. Add an "Edit DA" item to the FILE menu.	4. The code for the "Edit DA" menu item should be something	like this:		char *argv[] = {			"file1.c", "file2.c", "file3.c", 0		};      /* or whatever your source files are called */		edit_da() {			execv( "editor", argv );		}	You might need to use the form "volume:name" for your file	names, or to get the editor, depending on how you set things	up.This changes the test cycle from    editor -> compiler -> linker -> resource editor -> finder -> editorto    editor -> compiler -> linker -> program -> editorwhich can be faster.							Tim Smith
