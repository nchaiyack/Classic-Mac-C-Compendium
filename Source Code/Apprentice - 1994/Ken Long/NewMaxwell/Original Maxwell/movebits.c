/* * move or draw ball on screen */#include <qd.h>#include <qdvars.h>#include "ball.h"/* * There are three off-screen bitmaps.  The first two hold the images of * a slow ball and a fast ball.  The third is used for combining the * before and after pictures so that a screen update of a moving ball * whose new postion overlaps its old position can be done in one * screen operation.  This is intended to reduce flicker, by cutting * number of copybits calls to the screen from two to one per slow * moving ball.  However, it increases the total number of copybits * calls, which makes things run slower. * * The use of this third bitmap is enabled by defining SMOOTH.  It will * run ~25% slower with SMOOTH defined. */char sbits[ 2*(SDIM)*((SDIM+15)/16) ];		/* slow bits */char fbits[ 2*(SDIM)*((SDIM+15)/16) ];		/* fast bits */#ifdef SMOOTHchar dbits[ 2*(2*SDIM)*((2*SDIM+15)/16) ];	/* combined bits */#endifBitMap sm, fm							/* bitmaps for slow and fast bits */#ifdef SMOOTH	,dm									/* and combined bits */#endif;/* * movebits() draws two balls.
