This is an old, free program I downloaded from BMUG that did not run.

There's a lot of good ol' stuff in BMUG's External File Library, in the old
TBBS Folder, in the Source Folder.


Not even the original built application ran.  It was made in 1985, which is
one reason.  But it was also made for a MegaMax C compiler (whatever that
is/was).  So it was very easy to get it to run on an LC with System 7.0.1.

I had to add new window code, and I added a "brag blurb" but it's otherwise in
the form of the original.

Has possibilities for colorization, making it look like random polygons, etc.
Not anything that hasn't been done (witness: AfterDark), but it might be
something YOU haven't done.  Randomization could be removed and points set by
controls!

Anyway, "as soon as I fix 'em, I chucks 'em."  That is, as soon as I get an old
project to run on a current Think C version, I redistribute it for currently
novice C programmers to learn from.

Enjoy!
