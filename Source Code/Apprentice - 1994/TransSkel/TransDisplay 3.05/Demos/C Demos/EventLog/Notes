EventLog NotesThe behavior of this application varies depending on a number of factors, such as:System software capabilities.- If System 7 application launching capabilities are not available, the Launch item in the File menu will be disabled.- Under System 7, you can drag any document, folder, or disk onto the EventLog application.  Under system software prior to System 7, the EvtL Document can be selected opened to be passed to EventLog.  Under any system, you can select EvtL Document and choose Print to send a Print message to EventLog.- If Apple Events are supported, EventLog will set itself up to accept them. However, the actual events passed by the system depend on the SIZE flags you select under Set Project Type. If you select HighLevelEvent-Aware, Apple Events will be sent for the four required core Apple Events. If in addition the Accept ChildDied Events flag is set, you'll get Application Died events for applications launched from EventLog's Launch menu item (if you exit launched applications before exiting EventLog, of course).  Note: the Quit Application event is reported, but not acted upon.- If multi-tasking is supported, EventLog will report OS events.  Like Apple Events, this depends on the setting of the multi-tasking flags in the SIZE resource.You can build the application with various settings of these flags and see how its behavior differs.Warning: If you turn off the MultiFinder-Aware bit, the system fools applications into doing deactivates by creating a false window.  This window evidently has a garbage value in the title string, so you'll see trash in the event log window.
