/* * Given a rectangle, determine the following values: * - Which device contains more of the rectangle than any other * - The device rectangle (this includes the menu bar area if the device * is the main device) * - Whether or not the device is the main device * * These values are stuffed into the arguments, which are passed as * variable addresses.  If you're not interested in a particular value, * pass nil for the corresponding argument. * * The return value if true if the rectangle overlaps some device, * false if it lies outside all devices.  If the rectangle overlaps no * device, non-nil arguments are filled in with the main device, the main * device rect, and true, respectively.  This is useful, e.g., for callers * that may want to reposition a window if its content rectangle isn't * visible on some monitor. * * The returned device value will be nil on systems that don't have GDevices * (i.e.,, that don't support Color QuickDraw), even if the function result * is true. * * References: TN TB 30. */# include	"TransSkel.h"pascal BooleanSkelGetRectDevice (Rect *rp, GDHandle *rGD, Rect *devRect, Boolean *isMain){GDHandle	gd, curGD;Rect		gdRect, curRect, iSectRect;long		maxArea, area;Boolean		main = false;Boolean		result;			gd = (GDHandle) nil;				/* no device for rectangle known yet */	if (!SkelQuery (skelQHasColorQD))	{		/*		 * No Color QuickDraw implies only one screen, which is therefore		 * the main device.
